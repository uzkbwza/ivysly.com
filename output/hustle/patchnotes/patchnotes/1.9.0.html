<ul>
<li>UI now explicitly tells you when you are in a combo vs when you are in neutral.</li>
<li>Added UI info for current initiative state and which actions can use Initiative.</li>
<li>Added a sound that plays when your time is running out.</li>
<li>Hit particles should show up in the right place now.</li>
<li>Fixed prediction being off by 1 frame when hitcancelling against projectiles.</li>
<li>Added limit to chat message history.</li>
<li>Added option to mute chat sounds.<ul>
<li>Lobby chat is always muted when entering a match now.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Enabled experimental ghost options for 2x speed (thanks to welt for giving tips on the implementation)</li>
<li>Prediction speed setting is now saved.</li>
<li>Added distinction in the prediction text for moves that are interrupted on the opponents&rsquo; turn.</li>
<li>Added parry timing indicator to prediction.</li>
<li>Fixed bug causing characters to snap to the ground from high in the air in some situations.</li>

<li>Fixed hurtbox/collision boxes not always updating to face the right way.</li>
<li>Added hit frame display in prediction.</li>
<li>Experimental change to rematch button. Hopefully prevents crashing.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Character Loader update</h1>
<ul>
<li>I have (with permission) ported the critical parts of srPerez&rsquo;s character loader to the base game. You can unsubscribe from the Workshop mod. This shouldn&rsquo;t change much, but was needed as Mutant&rsquo;s inclusion broke character loader and the original mod is no longer actively maintained.</li>
<li>This does NOT mean you will automatically download your opponent&rsquo;s characters, though this could be the case sometime in the future.</li>
<li>The steam lobby UI has been updated to reflect this change. You can choose whether or not modded characters are enabled when creating a lobby, and you can see which lobbies have them.</li>
<li>I have made some QOL adjustments to the character loader, including a more robust character select screen (and the ability to update it in the future). Characters are now loaded in a separate thread, which completely removes the unpleasant lag every time you start the game or go to the main menu. Overall, <strong>modded characters will now be an officially supported feature and further improvements will be made over time.</strong></li>
</ul>
<h1>Character Changes</h1>
<h2>Mutant</h2>
<ul>
<li>New character, try it out!!!</li>
<li>Extreme rushdown/mobility character with low health and damage but very oppressive neutral.</li>
<li>Has a unique movement option, Juke, tied to a bar. 2 pips of juke bar can be used to shift Mutant in any direction without affecting momentum (usually), allowing for intensely deep rushdown and evasive movement strategies.</li>
<li>Envenom is a special throw that applies a poison status effect to the opponent. Poisoned opponents will take damage over time, and hitting them with melee attacks causes hazardous acid bubbles to fly out.</li>
</ul>
<h2>All characters</h2>
<ul>
<li>Air options have been reduced by 1 in neutral. Starting a combo adds an extra air option.</li>
<li>Low-health damage reduction (aka GUTS) has been removed.<ul>
<li>The visual effect on the healthbar remains.</li>
<li>This removes stupid tech like tax evasion (really) and overall just makes things easier to balance.</li>
<li>Maximum health has been increased to 15,000 (from 10,000) to compensate.</li>
<li>This is slightly higher than the old <em>effective</em> hp amount of about 14,000, after low-health damage reduction, which means matches will take slightly longer but will also be slightly less volatile (more skill-based), which was the other goal in adjusting the damage scaling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Meter gain globally reduced by 15% to compensate for the low-health damage reduction changes increasing overall meter gain.</li>
<li>Fixed a forbidden technique.</li>
<li>Velocity-based meter gain is now reduced by 50% while airborne</li>
<li>You can now hit projectiles and blocking opponents at the same time.</li>
<li>Possibly removed framekill related to cancelling an attack after hitting the opponent when they recover before you.</li>
<li>Hitstun now has a minimum of 1 frame (unless it was already 0 for some reason).</li>
<li>Melee parries now properly disable all interruptibility.</li>
<li>Moves that change IASA on hit no longer do so when hitting non-hitcancellable projectiles.</li>
<li>Removed extra frame of hitlag when hitcancelling against projectiles. This should remove the invisible framekill.</li>
<li>Removed unblockable involving projectiles hitting on the same frame as throw tech.</li>
<li>Parrying projectiles no longer scales your combo.</li>
<li>Slightly reduced knockdown hurtbox size.</li>
<li>Fixed throw tech preventing projectiles from hitting each other.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where all object interactions were being processed twice. Might cause other bugs, havent thoroughly tested.</li>
<li>Parrying melee attacks always forces the opponent out of a free cancel.</li>
<li>Fixed the parry damage scaling prediction error.</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed bug where hitting someone on the frame they would have exited hitstun removes the parry damage scaling.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Burst (all variants)</p>
<ul>
<li>Burst meter now builds 75% as fast during neutral, and 50% as fast if you are aerial during neutral.</li>
<li>No burst gain while Sadness is active.</li>
<li>No longer flippable</li>
<li>
<p>Burst Cancel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using Burst Cancel will slow Burst regeneration to 25% until your combo ends.</p>
</li>
<li>No longer resets combo damage proration.</li>
<li>
<p>New move for Ninja, Mutant, and modded characters: Super Fall</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Similar to Super Dash and Super Jump. Air move with some startup that sends you flying downward.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Whiff Cancel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No longer prevents opponent parry.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Landing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is now interruptible on the opponents&rsquo; turn when 4f or shorter. Does not apply when you are getting comboed obviously.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Throw</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Range is reduced across the cast.</p>
</li>
<li>IASA increased (15f -&gt; 16f)</li>
<li>
<p>Getup</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No longer flippable</p>
</li>
<li>No longer counts as a &ldquo;hurt&rdquo; state, fixing some small inconsistencies.</li>
<li>
<p>Jump</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Jump forward now has 1 frame of jump-squat before leaving the ground.</p>
</li>
<li>Full hop IASA increased (11f -&gt; 12f)</li>
<li>
<p>Block</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No longer causes sadness.</p>
</li>
<li>You can no longer double jump or use most other aerial options the turn after air-blocking.</li>
<li>Experimental block startup change that should help with a lot of the weird hitstop shenanigans. Probably extremely buggy and probably reintroduces old bugs - LMK</li>
<li>Blocking a melee attack no longer consumes an air option.</li>
<li>Is no longer minus on whiff during combos.</li>
<li>You can no longer parry melee attacks the turn after whiffing block. Guard breaks will be automatically softblocked.</li>
<li>Is no longer -1 on whiffing block.</li>
<li>Block timing is now shown on the previous move display.</li>
<li>Blockstun is now applied additively instead of reset to new value.</li>
<li>Fixed bug where interrupting on the same turn you block a non-block-cancellable move allows you to punish the opponent on block.</li>
<li>This is done by outright disabling any interrupt that might have been triggered before blocking on the same frame, so bugs may ensue.</li>
<li>Fixed bug that forced unblockables when blocking a projectile on the 20th frame. Might cause other problems, lmk</li>
<li>
<p>Push Block</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased pushback proc distance (110 -&gt; 220)</p>
</li>
<li>Fixed bug preventing push block after whiffed block.</li>
<li>
<p>Dash Backward</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed incorrect prediction</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ninja</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed a lot of ground-to-air and air-to-ground situations that didnt let you cancel into anything.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Caltrops</p>
<ul>
<li>Ninjas can hit their own caltrops and smack em around now. Thanks VineRaio :)</li>
<li>Attack launch angle is influenced by DI.</li>
<li>Hitting your own caltrops with a melee attack automatically free-cancels the attack.</li>
<li>
<p>Boost</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>reduced parry hitstop penalty (20f -&gt; 10f)</p>
</li>
<li>You can now stack stored momentum.</li>
<li>Can only store one Boost at a time.</li>
<li>Stored speed is reduced by 10%.</li>
<li>Stored speed is reduced every frame in neutral, more quickly at higher values.</li>
<li>Stored speed is reduced by 3.0 every time Ninja blocks or is hit.</li>
<li>
<p>Air Dash</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Anti-gravity effect no longer resets when hitting the opponent.</p>

<li>
<p>Shuriken</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Falls to the ground after 120f.</p>
</li>
<li>Throwing your shurikens at each other causes them to form a powered up version.<ul>
<li>The shuriken shrinks in size and damage (slightly) over time, until it disappears.</li>
<li>You can swat the powered up version. This is affected by DI only when hit by the Ninja that spawned it. It also grants a free cancel for the attacker.</li>
<li>Hitting the powered-up version with another shuriken increases its lifespan and size.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Increased aerial angle range.</li>
<li>Grounded IASA increased (14f -&gt; 16f)</li>

</li>
<li>
<p>Substitution</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Drastically reduced sadness penalty</p>
</li>
<li>Valid substitute distance from a projectile is determined by distance to the opponent instead of the player substituting, and the max horizontal distance is reduced (600px -&gt; 300px).</li>

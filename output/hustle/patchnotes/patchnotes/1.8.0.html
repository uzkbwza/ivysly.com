<ul>
<li>Added new experimental performance optimization code. Should improve prediction performance but might cause prediction (and other) errors. Let me know!</li>
<li>Free Cancel is now enabled by default (with option to turn this off.)</li>
<li>Uncapped FPS (does not affect gameplay logic)</li>
<li>Adjusted UI during move selection to allow for more space. Super meter and character info are now at the top when the game is paused.</li>
<li>Action buttons are now more obviously highlighted when selected.</li>
<li>Hitbox display can now be enabled during multiplayer</li>
<li>Melee attacks will now display their earliest hitbox frame in the action selector. This is experimental and some counts will probably be incorrect.</li>
<li>Fixed awkward scrolling behavior when there are more than 9 available moves in a category.</li>
<li>Added an indicator in the movelist for when more than 9 moves are available in a category.</li>
<li>Enabled rich text in emotes.</li>
</ul>
<h2>All Characters</h2>
<ul>
<li>All melee attacks can now be cancelled into defensive options, wait, fall, and grab.</li>
<li>Movement IASA has received a small blanket nerf to make it more committal and discourage passive strategies.</li>
<li>Clashes now occur when moves are within 250 damage of each other, from the previous 400.</li>
<li>Clashing melee attacks rewards one free cancel.</li>
<li>Counterhits now work properly on multihit attacks.</li>
<li>Added subtle SFX for when you gain 1 bar of meter.</li>
<li>Added slightly more pitch variance to the super SFX.</li>
<li>Getting parried or blocked will properly deactivate your active hitboxes now.</li>
<li>Added new block advantage indicator.</li>
<li>Sadness gain is greatly reduced if you are on the ground and the opponent is in the air, and moderately increased if you are in the air while the opponent is on the ground.</li>
<li>Additionally, sadness reduction is moderately nerfed if airborne while the opponent is grounded.</li>
<li>Reduced the negative sadness penalty cap</li>
<li>Projectiles can have different properties in and out of combos now. Might cause some bugs.</li>
<li>
<p>Characters are unaffected by Sadness changes for 60 frames after exiting hitstun.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Burst</p>
<ul>
<li>Is now usable in neutral</li>
<li>Landing it in neutral gains you nearly 2 bars of meter, and the opponent is invulnerable for the duration of hitstun.</li>
<li>Can no longer clash.</li>
<li>
<p>Hustle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Adds a lot of sadness to the opponent if started during neutral.</p>
</li>
<li>Sadness wont be applied if the opponent is also using Hustle.</li>
<li>1 additional point of sadness is applied to the opponent every 4 frames that Hustle is active and grounded.</li>
<li>
<p>Block</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Block has been reworked. Now blocking is much safer (though not completely risk-free), and parrying is harder (but has almost the same reward as before). Making defense safer should encourage fighters to stay closer together, as the risk for being in the opponent&rsquo;s threat range is not so high. This is a better and more satisfying alternative to the current meta of simply running away.</p>
</li>
<li>Most moves have had their block advantage altered. The way it works is like so: if you have a block advantage of +3, it adds 3 frames of startup to your opponent&rsquo;s move.</li>
<li>Air block has dramatically reduced pushback.</li>
<li>Blocking will not normally be punished by moves with delayed hitboxes anymore.</li>
<li>You must guess the timing of the opponent&rsquo;s melee attack to parry it, which is a 1f window.<ul>
<li>Credit to VineRaio for the idea and much of the implementation</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Reworked high/low blocking. Block is now a single move that blocks both low and high.<ul>
<li>Added option to predict high or low attacks within Block. This functions differently than before: both versions will block all attacks, but you must match the attack height to land a parry, and predicting wrong will disadvantage you by an additional 2 frames and you will take some extra chip damage.</li>
<li>The reason for this is that low attacks are not distinct enough from highs and mids, which means that blocking them is less interesting and more of a pure 50/50 gambling situation that makes certain moves ridiculously powerful. The choice was between doing this or reworking a lot of moves to be a lot worse on hit.</li>
<li>In place of lows&rsquo; previous function, certain melee attacks when launched on the same turn have a new Guard Break property. They cannot be blocked; they must be parried. Landing a guard break will adjust combo proration to 1.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Soft blocking melee attacks costs an air option.</li>
<li>Some moves are now punishable on block outright.</li>
<li>Attacking a blocking opponent who is in the air gets you another +2f.</li>
<li>Parrying the opponent scales your combo to 85% damage except against block-punishable moves where it remains 100%. Since fishing for parries is now much lower-risk with the other block changes, this should help temper the reward.</li>
<li>Parry reduces sadness when used against melee attacks.</li>
<li>Parrying projectiles no longer incurs sadness penalty.</li>
<li>Can no longer be grabbed during blockstun at all.<ul>
<li>Throw hitboxes that collide with a character in blockstun will not hit meaty.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The attacker gets their Free Cancel back when their attack is blocked, but not the defender.</li>
<li>Blocking now resets all forward momentum.</li>
<li>Heavily reduced meter gain when dealing/taking chip damage</li>
<li>Blocking during a combo is still unsafe if you dont end up blocking anything.</li>
<li>Removed advantage storing (all projectiles are +2).</li>
<li>Removed melee autoparry after parrying projectiles.</li>
<li>Parrying projectiles and free-cancelled melee attacks is unchanged.</li>
<li>Attacking the opponent&rsquo;s block reduces sadness a bit.</li>
<li>
<p>Push Block</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can spend 1 meter to push block which increases block knockback. You cannot parry from push block.</p>
</li>
<li>Pushblock will always push the opponent away from you if they are close, even if you block a projectile.</li>
<li>

<li>
<p>Getup</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Characters are immune to throws for 2 frames after getup.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Landing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Landing will now add extra recovery in neutral to prevent turns shorter than 10 frames.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hustle</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed anti-sadness tech from Hustling right as you&rsquo;re about to get sadness from the opponent&rsquo;s Hustle. Now you must have started your Hustle within 1 frame of the opponent&rsquo;s.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Mutant</h2>

<li>I was too busy balancing everyone else but now that the game is perfect I have time for slopman</li>
</ul>
<h2>Ninja</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Ninja has been a little underwhelming in the last release, so I&rsquo;ve given the character some more useful tools and tweaked old ones to be more worth considering.

<h2>Cowboy</h2>
<ul>
<li>Cowboy has got a lot of changes, mainly to Teleport and bullet-related moves. Many of the changes are to help with QOL, anti-stalling, and better interacting with the new block system. Cowboy has also been tweaked to replace unsightly optimal combos (throw loops) with cooler and more interactive ones. Cowboy has had a lot of issues in the past with ignoring DI and being able to run away with no accountability, so the teleport changes should force the character to play a more honest game while still retaining the fun parts.</li>
<li>Draw Cancel now works on block.</li>
<li>
<p>All normal attacks except Pommel are now draw cancellable.</p>

<li>Consumes a bullet now.</li>
<li>Fires in the direction of DI.</li>

<li>

<li>
<p>Bullet damage should be reduced properly on consecutive hits from the same projectile now (it wasn&rsquo;t before).</p>
</li>
<li>Bullet hitstun is halved every time it hits the enemy (min 5f).</li>
<li>Fixed one bullet hitbox not having a minimum damage value</li>
<li>Bullet is now +2 on block.</li>
<li>Bullet chip damage modifier decreased (0.75x -&gt; 0.67x)</li>

<h2>Wizard</h2>
<ul>
<li>Wizard has been in a good place for a little while, so changes aren&rsquo;t as big as with the other characters. However, I&rsquo;ve tweaked Wizard&rsquo;s moveset to better work with the new blocking (as I have with other characters).

<h2>Robot</h2>
<ul>
<li>Many changes made this patch are in the spirit of improving Robot&rsquo;s neutral while toning down excessive damage (while still keeping it characteristically high).</li>
<li>Can now automatically cancel certain moves into and out of Drive.</li>
<li>Now utilizes extra color 2 for customization.</li>
<li>Getting hit will only disable LOIC if Robot goes into hitstun.</li>
<li>Drive cancel now works on block.</li>
<li>
<p>Updated some icons</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Armor</p>
<ul>
<li>Instead of Robot being able to power through any move, getting hit while in Armor forces Robot to block. By landing Kill Process, however, you can restore the prior functionality of armor for one use.</li>
<li>This change came of feedback from both casual and competitive players who feel that fighting as and against Robot can become passive and unfun due to Armor discouraging neutral interactions. This should give some advantage to the attacker while still being an extremely strong tool for Robot to shrug off enemy attacks.</li>
<li>Can no longer be used on Defense or Movement options (except Step)</li>
<li>
<p>Flight</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased fly duration per air option (20f -&gt; 25f)</p>

<li>Super Jump reduces Robot&rsquo;s air options to 2.</li>
<li>Can once again fly &amp; block at the same time</li>
<li>Flying backward or straight up gives Robot some Sadness.</li>
<li>Robot won&rsquo;t keep flying after Fly is unchecked.</li>
<li>Flying down will more rapidly counteract upward momentum.</li>
<li>
<p>Dodge</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Can no longer fly during dodge.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>New move: Propel</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Grounded movement option. 12f IASA. Goes a fixed distance. Robot slides a little after it&rsquo;s over.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Super Jump</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Has innate projectile armor for 30 frames starting on frame 8</p>

<li>
<p>Increased IASA during flight (8f -&gt; 10f)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Landing</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Reduced hitbox width (40,000 -&gt; 200).</p>
</li>
<li>Reduced damage by 70% (this accounts for the massive and ridiculous damage increase you could get using Fly)</li>
<li>Hitbox centers on Robot instead of the opponent now.</li>
<li>Is no longer hit-cancellable (QOL, shouldnt really ever make a difference).</li>
<li>
<p>Kill Process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Landing this powers up your next use of armor to ignore enemy attacks&rsquo; knockback and continue with your selected move (like before).</p>
</li>
<li>Invulnerability starts later (1f -&gt; 2f)</li>
<li>Projectile invulnerability lasts for the whole move.</li>
<li>
<p>Gravity Field</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Removed. After months of experimentation there&rsquo;s little possibility to make a move like this fit with the game&rsquo;s design goals. It&rsquo;s uninteractive and a boring solution to robot&rsquo;s main problems. Hopefully the other buffs should make up for it.</p>

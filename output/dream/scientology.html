<div class="dream-content">
    <p>We were at an indoor Scientologist theme park of sorts, very 90s. Verdict was that they were not terrible at designing rides and games. They had this &ldquo;key&rdquo; system where you&rsquo;d earn these strange items by completing rides and learning scientology related lessons. they snuck these keys into real video games (one I remember was Myst) and they had their own little motif that played when you found one. they weren&rsquo;t really keys but a sort of oblong red polyhedron with a golden wireframe shape extruding from the long end, like an abstract key already stuck in a lock.</p>
<p>One of the rides near the beginning (which to us was the end, as we went backward through the park) was the &ldquo;gay straight bar&rdquo;. it was like a caged  carousel with a bar in the center. they had an advertisement playing, with shitty 90s advertisement hip hop, and it explained the ride. the song went &ldquo;gay bar!&rdquo; and the riders booed. then it went &ldquo;straight bar!&rdquo; and the riders cheered, followed by a repeating &ldquo;gay bar straight bar gay bar straight bar &hellip;&rdquo; as the ride sped up the bargoers all stood up and held hands. it struck me as unusually progressive for a 90s theme park ride to address such topics</p>

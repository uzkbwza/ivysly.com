    <p>I'm trapped in Hell, or something. I have to complete difficult tasks to not be tortured. The one I finally failed was to count all instances of the number 12 in some (insurance?) document. We were floating in a void, on some strange structure. My captor was not visible to me, but I could hear him taunt and belittle me. My first punishment, incidentally, was to be sat in one place with no new tasks, or anything to do for one week.</p>

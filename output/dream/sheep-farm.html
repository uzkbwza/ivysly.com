<!-- <h4>Sheep Farm</h4> -->

<div class="dream-content">
    <p>I visit a ranch. There is a sheep farm. I am eating dinner, outside, at a long table with the farmer on one side and I on the other. The sheep are held up by their necks so that they learn to stand upright. The sheep are eating alongside us, suspended by their nooses on the sides of the table. They're taught to say "CHEWING" and "SWALLOWING" when they eat food. I ask the farmer why they do this. A particularly intelligent, disembodied sheep's head on the table tells me it's because it makes the sheep taste better.</p>

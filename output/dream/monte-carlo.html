    <p>I'm in British Columbia, but it's on the other side of the continent, and is named Monte Carlo. I want to explore, but I began work at [local call center] and could not leave my hotel room. I leave anyway. Exploring the building, there's a lot of people especially in the lobby. French accent guy wants to know where he can get food. I keep seeing this beautiful pregnant woman with short, brown hair.</p>

<p>my name is Ian Sly (Ivy is just Ian upside-down; you can call me either). the thing you may already know about me is that i created a turn-based fighting game called <a href="./games/your-only-move-is-hustle.html"><em>Your Only Move Is HUSTLE</em></a>. below are some other details.</p>
<p>i was born in Portland, Oregon, and have lived in the nearby city of Eugene since i was eight. assuming i have not died by the time you read this, i am <time datetime="1997-05-07" data-timeformat="relative"></time> old. <time datetime="2015" data-timeformat="relative"></time> ago i dropped out of high school to smoke weed and play video games. since then i made a lot of <a href="./games.html">video games</a> and <a href="./music.html">computer music</a>. the internet tells me i am a Taurus, INFP, a cusp Zoomer, and a wordcel. i am nonreligious. you could place my political beliefs on the anarchist spectrum.</p>
<p>i have never worked a real job and I do not plan to. i think everyone should have the opportunity to not work. i would sooner return to living on pennies in a tin can apartment than lose the capacity to be creative during daylight hours. what a joke it is that all you need to go from deadbeat slacker to <em>entrepreneur</em> is a little profit.</p>
<p>making stuff is my life path. it is involuntary and invariant. just writing this sentence is satisfying. fixations have shaped every decision i've ever made.</p>
<p>if you like the way i talk, you can read my <a href="./blog.html">blog</a>. if you like the way i think, you can take a look at my <a href="./dream.html">dreams</a>. if you think the way i like, we might agree on my <a href="./misc/favs.html">favs</a>. and if you just don't like me, you might still like my <a href="./misc/friends.html">friends</a>.</p>
<p>i am, lastly, the sole credited inventor of a widely acclaimed data structure called the bonglewunch.</p>

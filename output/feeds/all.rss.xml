If the typical oddball middle-budget game design of the 6th and 7th console generations shaped my adolescence, the unending stream of risk averse committee designed AAAA storefront experiences that followed completely alienated me. something in my adulthood has been driving me backward, not just to my childhood but to a period before anything for which I would have any feelings of nostalgia. there&amp;rsquo;s something about the freedom they had in the 20th century to just try anything, a freedom from convention. Tomb Raider, a game everyone knows about, for which they made a $115,000,000 budget movie starring angelina jolie, is a surprisingly idiosyncratic game wonderfully free from convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tomb Raider is really nothing like Mario 64 in a way that begs just that comparison. It almost feels like a modern statement about some homogeneity of control schemes and character controllers in games where you move a guy around, but damn if they highkenuinely didn&amp;rsquo;t just come up with a truly worthy branch of the 3d Platformer lineage out the dome and nobody decided to iterate on it because it doesn&amp;rsquo;t immediately tranquilize you. If Mario is about jerking off, with all sorts of silly techniques you&amp;rsquo;ll never actually need to progress through any of the game, then Tomb Raider is a good fucking, not in the sense that it&amp;rsquo;s hard but because it just takes a little more thought and deliberation, more cooperation with the game, exploration, and the reward is so much greater even when the result is the same. the challenge is so much more layered, so much more systematic that even just the action of clearing a small gap becomes a source of intense satisfaction and anxiety. Tomb Raider does have its own share of masturbatory techniques, but they are so brazen in their uselessness you&amp;rsquo;d think it were deliberate commentary. Mario never prepared me for this, maybe it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t have. I&amp;rsquo;m getting tired of comparing the two. We&amp;rsquo;ve been doing it for 30 years. She&amp;rsquo;s out of his league.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The traversal system in Tomb Raider uniquely creates a challenge out of obstacles that would be trivial to pass in any other game. Lara isn&amp;rsquo;t a bounding box with a gravity force but a truly physical agent that operates under believable rules, and visually, audibly struggles to navigate the world in a way that matches the player&amp;rsquo;s own contact with purposefully textural mechanics. the grid based system alleviates the guesswork of jumping in a novel way, while still remaining tricky to execute and satisfying to land a rapid, calculated sequence of maneuvers. you&amp;rsquo;ll find all sorts of interesting details in the system, like how landing from a jump without running or rolling out of it allows you to instantly jump again without anticipation—your knees are already bent. careful players might find out you can initiate the two-step running jump by taking a walking step before a running step, allowing skilled players to do so with a shorter approach. there&amp;rsquo;s a kind of maturity to the systems here that would never fly in modern industrial gamedev. the level design matches this careful attention to detail. they really pushed how natural you can make a grid of blocks appear, and they found every permutation they could of the arrangement of these blocks to form unique platforming challenges. not to mention all the little clever, efficient setpieces (including many surprises i won&amp;rsquo;t mention—best to experience them blind), like a waterfall section that has you tumbling back down the rapids at every mistake, or a drop into a huge underground reservoir with partially submerged statues, leaving you to dive uncomfortably deep to explore for goodies and exits before having to come all the way back up for air. did I mention the swimming is just as fleshed out and natural as the platforming?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;on the other hand I didn&amp;rsquo;t love the boring combat and how often you are required to engage with it. It really brings down the eerie vibes (and the vibes are just impeccable, I mean I love when a game relies on ambience instead of music and actually let me comment on just how good the sound design is in this game, which is very good, feels both intimate and spacious in a way that really sells every flavor of dank evil cave) of exploring an ancient, possibly supernatural, maybe even a smidge liminal sort of space when suddenly a door opens and unleashed is a band of rabid gorillas making oddly human sounds and you gotta just jump on the nearest platform they can&amp;rsquo;t climb and wail on the triggers for a while. The amount of wanton animal murder rouses some latent vegan part of me because holy shit does it feel bad to be forced to essentially execute dozens of helpless animals every ten minutes. I guess it is a form of ludonarrative harmony, though, that a ransacker of ancient human gravesites would take no issue in killing the way Lara does, and her superhuman precision in wiping out even the most distant targets with her double uzis implies she has had a lot of practice doing so. I understand why they put this in the game—she is sooooo hot and badass when she got her guns out—but it would be a lot more interesting if she could have used them more against smarter, more justifiable human targets, and as an added dimension to puzzles. The constant hostility of these animals feels for some reason like an echo of a greater theme, that Tomb Raider believes these dead exotic civilizations would have been so cruel and evil were they still around, that you, the hero, are well within your moral duty to kill everything and take all their shit. Just felt worth mentioning after the splash screen at the start that says &amp;ldquo;sorry the game is low key racist, thanks for buying it&amp;rdquo;. There is more generally an undercurrent of brutality to the game that lands between tastefully mature and flagrantly pornographic, made more suspicious in retrospect by the voyeuristic torture simulation aspect that the Tomb Raider franchise has become infamous for. the game matter of factly portrays Lara&amp;rsquo;s many modes of death in a way that reminds me of Rain World, except uncomfortably recontextualized by our avatar&amp;rsquo;s apparent design as a sex object foremost. the camera does not pan away but leers directly at the dead woman just as it would were she still alive, allowing the player to orbit and zoom on her corpse for a long time before selecting a savepoint to return to. prior to playing this game, my only preconceptions about Tomb Raider were of white painted ledges and pornogore snuff movies, just one of which I can dispel with confidence.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another elephant: &lt;a href="https://kayin.moe/why-play-a-remake"&gt;remasters are stupid&lt;/a&gt;. 
I would rather just play a nice port with gamepad support. art doesn&amp;rsquo;t really need to be fucked with, but I understand some people get really sad if they do not make a lot of money next quarter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Playing the Tomb Raider remasters with modern controls will absolutely rob you of the carefully crafted platforming challenges that literally define the whole game. the specific interplay of mechanics originally designed for the game are instrumental to the game&amp;rsquo;s pace and feel. modern is only a fix if you view gameplay as a problem. entire mechanics are removed, like the back step and multiple jumping techniques, and most platforming sections become repetitive and toothless. i&amp;rsquo;m not saying classic controls are better because they are harder. the problem is that modern controls essentially cut away half of the gameplay, leaving a corpse of a game obviously meant for a different set of systems. if you just don&amp;rsquo;t fuck with tank controls you&amp;rsquo;d be better off playing a different game. i mean this in the least judgmental way (i have quit games over far more petty quibbles ask me about it). there are other games that would suit you better than the travesty that is an amputated Tomb Raider. don&amp;rsquo;t waste your time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I mostly stuck to classic graphics, I also took a peek at the new visuals here and there. it&amp;rsquo;s clear to me that not only did this game really not need a graphical overhaul, it seems they went out of their way to make it as shit and flat and ugly as they possibly could. I can&amp;rsquo;t lie and say the classic graphics are always easy to look at, but the game undeniably had an artful, deliberate goal with the severe, vibrant vertex lighting that got replaced with a ubiquitous gloomy haze and modern color grades draped lovelessly over strangely literal, realism-hopeful (ai-upscaled?) reinterpretations of the original environment textures, totally massacring the gestural impressionism of the source material. with the level geometry unchanged, it feels like an overly ambitious modpack. there are lots of choices made to make the game&amp;rsquo;s environments seem more realistic when the dreamlike quality of the original levels ironically felt more immersive. They completely missed the strange appeal of a game where you never see the sky, choosing to add skylights where they never were before. I really don&amp;rsquo;t understand what they were going for. It&amp;rsquo;s clearly the worst genre of graphical update a game could receive, and one of the most heinous executions of that genre I have ever seen. You can find more tasteful texture mods for Minecraft. And don&amp;rsquo;t get me started on what they did to Lara Croft. the very 90s bombshell femme fatale thing she had going on was certainly not a groundbreaking feminist statement by any means but at least it was more interesting than the sex doll we got in the remastered graphics, doubtlessly created for aging millennials who grew up yearning to merely fuck this psycho queen, a recreation of their wistful memory of the Sex Object instead of the reality that she is a Kill Person, about whom one more correctly should feel an ocean of fear and a droplet of sadistic arousal when she gets torn to pieces by panthers or impaled in suspiciously overbloody spike pits—SORRY! don&amp;rsquo;t blame the messenger, the designers just put all that stuff in the game themselves.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 10 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/reviews/tomb-raider-2024</guid></item><item><title>public statement to all ice employees</title><link>https://ivysly.com/blog/ice</link><description>&lt;div style="font-size: clamp(3em, 10vw, 8em); font-weight: bold; line-height 1.1;"&gt;KILL YOURSELF&lt;/div&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 28 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/blog/ice</guid></item><item><title>Scientology</title><link>https://ivysly.com/dream/scientology</link><description>&lt;p&gt;We were at an indoor Scientologist theme park of sorts, very 90s. Verdict was that they were not terrible at designing rides and games. They had this &amp;ldquo;key&amp;rdquo; system where you&amp;rsquo;d earn these strange items by completing rides and learning scientology related lessons. they snuck these keys into real video games (one I remember was Myst) and they had their own little motif that played when you found one. they weren&amp;rsquo;t really keys but a sort of oblong red polyhedron with a golden wireframe shape extruding from the long end, like an abstract key already stuck in a lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the rides near the beginning (which to us was the end, as we went backward through the park) was the &amp;ldquo;gay straight bar&amp;rdquo;. it was like a caged  carousel with a bar in the center. they had an advertisement playing, with shitty 90s advertisement hip hop, and it explained the ride. the song went &amp;ldquo;gay bar!&amp;rdquo; and the riders booed. then it went &amp;ldquo;straight bar!&amp;rdquo; and the riders cheered, followed by a repeating &amp;ldquo;gay bar straight bar gay bar straight bar &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; as the ride sped up the bargoers all stood up and held hands. it struck me as unusually progressive for a 90s theme park ride to address such topics&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/dream/scientology</guid></item><item><title>solo gamedev with lisp</title><link>https://ivysly.com/blog/sologamedev-with-lisp</link><description>&lt;p&gt;this last month or so i have been using the &lt;a href="https://fennel-lang.org/"&gt;Fennel programming language&lt;/a&gt;, a Lisp dialect that transpiles to Lua. if you want the quick pitch: it&amp;rsquo;s a fast, imperative-oriented Lisp with macros that i think is perfectly suited to solo indie gamedev. i love it for all the reasons &lt;a href="https://ivysly.com/blog/daydreaming-with-lua"&gt;i love Lua&lt;/a&gt; and more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i had been interested in using a Lisp for some time—actually, had i the option, i would have probably picked a hypothetical LuaJIT With Macros first—but it always felt like there were hurdles and gotchas that prevented me from using it productively in game development. first is that the ecosystem is obviously pretty tiny for many Lisps. tooling, build systems and libraries can be a bit DIY, especially if you are not using Emacs (i might give it another go, now). Fennel circumvents much of this by just being Lua. &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=JarodWright.strict-paredit-fennel"&gt;paredit&lt;/a&gt; + &lt;a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eduarddyckman.vscode-parinfer"&gt;parinfer&lt;/a&gt; with VS Code does the job of removing the parentheses pain well enough. this is the lesser issue. the bigger barrier is that Lisps are generally regarded as being on the functional side of programming languages, which, in the gamedev universe, means unknown, treacherous waters. games are highly stateful, highly imperative systems. it can be onerous trying to squeeze the slippery shape of a game into &lt;a href="https://prog21.dadgum.com/23.html"&gt;the result of a pure function&lt;/a&gt;. not to say that functional techniques have no place in gamedev, just that i find it difficult to apply them at the structural level. while some people are happy to take on such a challenge, i feel it is more practical for me to work in a perspective i&amp;rsquo;m familiar with. Fennel just so happens to feel exactly like Lua with a different syntax, because it is. i&amp;rsquo;m essentially doing the same things i was doing before, with a few trade-offs. this led me to a breakthrough: Lisp doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be anything. there are very few limits on what they &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; be. a Lisp has become in my mind solely defined as a direct representation of an AST made of &lt;a href="https://igor.io/2012/12/06/sexpr"&gt;s-expressions&lt;/a&gt;. you&amp;rsquo;ve probably seen s-expressions before. they&amp;rsquo;re just hiding in JSONs and &lt;a href="https://defmacro.org/ramblings/lisp.html"&gt;XMLs&lt;/a&gt;. you can write a Lisp with all the features of another language. it doesn&amp;rsquo;t even need to have a linked list data structure (Fennel&amp;rsquo;s lists only exist at compile time—even then, you spend most of your time just interfacing with Lua tables, with lists themselves in fact just being tables with some metadata). any other preconceptions you have about Lisp, you can safely let them go. &lt;a href="https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-49/srfi-49.html"&gt;Lisps don&amp;rsquo;t even need to have parentheses&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fennel is not really at all a pure-functional or declarative language. due to the severe restriction of being a zero-overhead Lua transpiler, the Fennel language doesn&amp;rsquo;t even ship with any of its own functions. what it does have is access to all of Lua&amp;rsquo;s built-in functions and table operations, many of which are good old imperative, stateful operations. you very well &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; turn Fennel into a pure, declarative language, or you could do something completely different. that&amp;rsquo;s because Fennel (and Lisp) isn&amp;rsquo;t really anything at all but a syntax. it doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be anything until you make it something, and you are given carte blanche to do so with macros.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;with macros, a Lisp essentially becomes an extension of the programmer&amp;rsquo;s mental model of the program. it&amp;rsquo;s amazing how simple it is. you should probably exercise more prudence in teams, but as a solo developer, it&amp;rsquo;s pretty amazing to be able to freely add my own natural-language constructs to the language with no runtime overhead. for example, one of the most common mathematical operations i tend to do in game dev is dividing things by two. &lt;code&gt;somevar / 2&lt;/code&gt; shows up hundreds or thousands of times in my typical code bases. in Fennel (and most other Lisps), it&amp;rsquo;s dead simple to introduce a macro &lt;code&gt;(half somevar)&lt;/code&gt; that compiles to the same thing, both reducing symbol noise and increasing clarity of intent. there&amp;rsquo;s no function call overhead, so the only reason not to use it is when semantically it wouldn&amp;rsquo;t make sense. this i think is an incredible feature for idiosyncratic solo devs like me, because while you might make your code &lt;a href="https://marktarver.com/bipolar.html"&gt;unreadable for anyone but you&lt;/a&gt;, it can become highly readable &lt;em&gt;for you&lt;/em&gt;, and even more so quickly writeable. again, a Lisp can be &lt;em&gt;anything&lt;/em&gt;. this means it can be exactly what you want out of a programming language, with technically no concessions except that you might have to put in the work to get it there (there is a reason most DSLs written in Lisp tend to look a lot like Lisp).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fennel and &lt;a href="https://love2d.org/"&gt;LÖVE&lt;/a&gt; go very well together. i have found that plugging into my existing codebase was very easy. even getting an in-game REPL going only took a few minutes, and already i can sense the crazy amount of power it gives me to tweak things on the fly. and since it&amp;rsquo;s just Lua, it might be one of the faster Lisps when JITted with a great incremental garbage collector, very well suited to gamedev. being a solo dev, for me, means writing stuff quickly without spending too much time on tedious bookkeeping and careful structuring one might need to do in a larger team. for the lone gamedev, i think a controlled amount of yolo-coding is how you get shit made. this is a huge strength of Lisp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;one funny problem with the switch from Lua is that now my engine uses three naming conventions; camelCase for the &lt;code&gt;love&lt;/code&gt; namespace, snake_case for my own preferred identifier style in Lua, and now kebab-case for all the symbols in Lisp. things can get pretty hairy when writing code that interfaces with all of these. nothing i can&amp;rsquo;t fix by rewriting my whole engine in Fennel of course.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;another small pain point is the notation for arithmetic. it&amp;rsquo;s just not as intuitive to read &lt;code&gt;a * b + c + d - e - f&lt;/code&gt; in the prefix notated form &lt;code&gt;(+ (* a b) c (- d e f))&lt;/code&gt;, but i suspect it could eventually end up being just about so, and i&amp;rsquo;m already developing adequate proficiency anyway. disregarding Lisp for this reason feels about as arbitrary and nitpicky as dismissing Lua for starting array indices at 1. you get used to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;as of writing i have only one completed project in Fennel. i just released a &lt;a href="../games/fishbone"&gt;jam game&lt;/a&gt; i made largely with Fennel, plugged in to my Lua LÖVE engine. i suspect my opinion will change in various ways as i continue to use it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;anyway with my main theses out of the way i am excited to just jabber more about the ridiculous utility of macros. the real pervert crap. it&amp;rsquo;s often the case that you want to repeat the same complicated logic on multiple values across multiple lines, but introducing a lambda (in Lua, at least) may add an unacceptable performance overhead, and putting it somewhere else in the program restricts its utility as a closure. on the contrary, inline macros let you capture the context like a closure and duplicate logic without polluting your code with a bunch of repeated procedures (which could easily break should you forget to update all of them when you need to change it), with none of the overhead of creating and calling an actual function. as a very minimal example, imagine this naive code, in the input handling function for the player somewhere:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;input-held?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;up&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;move-player!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;* &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;speed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;delta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;input-held?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;down&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;move-player!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;* &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;speed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;delta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;input-held?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;left&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;move-player!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;* &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;- &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;speed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;delta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;input-held?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;right&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;move-player!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;* &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;speed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;delta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;in this example, it would be overkill to introduce a local function to simplify the logic, and is currently a lot of noise to repeat the logic for each direction. a macro can combine the best of both options while making the important logic much more clear. plus it keeps all relevant code in the same place without you needing to search for another function that exists somewhere else. it does all this with no runtime overhead, as the following snippet compiles to code roughly equivalent to the previous block:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kd"&gt;macro &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;player-input-move!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;do &lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;unpack&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;fcollect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;select &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;# &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;let &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;input&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;dirx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;diry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;select &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;...&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;move-player!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;* &lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="nv"&gt;dirx&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;speed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;delta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;          &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;* &lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="nv"&gt;diry&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;speed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;delta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))))))))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;player-input-move!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;up&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;down&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;left&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;right&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this compiles to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;do&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;move-player!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;* &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;speed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;delta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;* &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;-1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;speed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;delta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="w"&gt;  &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;if &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;input-held?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s"&gt;&amp;quot;right&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="w"&gt;    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;move-player!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;* &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;speed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;delta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;* &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;speed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="w"&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;delta&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;the only meaningful difference being a few extra (cheap) multiplications, which could easily be refactored out as needed. i&amp;rsquo;d bet money that LuaJIT ignores multiplications by zero literal on hot loops anyway. when performance isn&amp;rsquo;t a concern, it usually will be cleaner to simply write a function, of course, but game dev performance is often death by a thousand cuts, with lots and lots of little inefficiencies that pile up. macros in Fennel allow you to define behavior &lt;em&gt;anywhere&lt;/em&gt; free of risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you can get a lot more complicated than this too. i wrote DSLs for defining object classes and state machines. the latter only took an afternoon. I&amp;rsquo;ll leave you with what i am calling the &lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ivysly.com/post/3m7jtgmthek2c"&gt;brohoof operator&lt;/a&gt;: a macro that divides two values in the opposite order they are passed:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;code&gt;(macro \ [lhs rhs]
  `(/ ,rhs ,lhs))

It&amp;rsquo;s not really any more difficult. The default settings are really, really bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Copy Kitty triggers a feeling of familial recognition I last had while playing Rabi-Ribi: these people, too, are perverts. But while Rabi-Ribi was a sort of uneven work with a voyeuristic perversion that worked against its themes and mechanics, Copy Kitty makes no pretense about gratuitously, ubiquitously indulging its own age-regressive power fantasy. It is not so often you get such direct passage into the squishy, gooey, plushy heart of a game&amp;rsquo;s author and it is especially less often that you get to pilot it yourself to such decadent heights.
This game really does feel like a little kid designed it, if a little kid could be born with a mastery of gameplay programming and technical art, plus drawings good enough that you could hang them up on the fridge without embarrassment. It&amp;rsquo;s the kind of game a little kid might pray every day to be brought to existence in the magical way you think games work when you&amp;rsquo;re young, a naive ideal game form that, in reality, is just a little too idealistic, only communicable in a breathless chain of &amp;ldquo;and then&amp;rdquo;s. And then you combine the lightning and the explosions to make lightning explosions, and then you set the lightning explosions on fire, and then you blow up the terrain and it flies everywhere in big flaming chunks, and then you fight a giant robot and then when you beat the giant robot you get in the giant robot and then fight another giant robot, etc, and then a wise and weathered adult like you or me would say, yes sweetheart that would be delightful wouldn&amp;rsquo;t it, and then the little kid grows up to actually make that game real.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 18 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/reviews/copy-kitty</guid></item><item><title>Bag</title><link>https://ivysly.com/dream/bag</link><description>&lt;p&gt;we accidentally put a plastic bag full of food over Dennis&amp;rsquo; nose and mouth and leave it there for hours. he seems fine, but when I take it off he telepathically communicates to me that it was the most painful thing he has ever experienced&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/dream/bag</guid></item><item><title>Downtown</title><link>https://ivysly.com/dream/downtown</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m downtown, and the military is here. a woman is doing bag checks on the side walk.

–some asshole&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;every day i go on a walk because my gf calls me fat if i don&amp;rsquo;t and it makes me feel bad so i do it. when i go outside for my daily shame walk i think about how there hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a time in my life longer than a week or two where I haven&amp;rsquo;t heard the sound of cars, haven&amp;rsquo;t seen a billboard, haven&amp;rsquo;t looked upon all the asphalt and concrete and wondered what the world looked like before we paved it all into stupid shitty roads and sidewalks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;recently a bluesky post reminded me of something said by Shigeru Miyamoto in an interview:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;If it&amp;rsquo;s really nice outside, you should go play outside. And I tell that to people who want to be game designers as well, you know? If it&amp;rsquo;s a nice day, you know, go experience outside, because really, I think there&amp;rsquo;s an important factor that it&amp;rsquo;s your personal experience.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and wow I bet that shit is so useful if you grew up in the Kyoto countryside 70 years ago but I think I speak for the rest of us when I say please keep your advice to yourself dumbass! there is no outside anymore. in a physical sense it is true I can drive to the river or the mountain (and truly my neck of the woods is in no way starving for natural features) but there is no longer any way to spend time in these places in good faith. how can I just go outside and &lt;em&gt;play&lt;/em&gt;? have you seen the &lt;em&gt;news&lt;/em&gt;? have you seen what people are doing to each other? outside is fake now. you go outside to pretend you aren&amp;rsquo;t still online in your heart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;games are an escape from reality as much as prison is an escape from civilization. game design is about creating the most comfortable cell. maybe the most ethically designed game would offend so thoroughly the sensibilities of its gamer that he or she would wake up and finally, fully understand their physical and spiritual carceration and escape into the dinosaur world&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 15 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/blog/there-is-no-grass-to-touch-anymore</guid></item><item><title>Redwoods</title><link>https://ivysly.com/dream/redwoods</link><description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re in Northern California, at the redwoods. I&amp;rsquo;m with my friend who is a Japanese salaryman on vacation. We&amp;rsquo;re on a dirt road surrounded by massive beautiful sequoias. Nearby is the largest monster truck ramp in the world. My friend suggests we jump it, but I think we should start with a smaller ramp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a hardware store. It&amp;rsquo;s just me and my friend. I see something that interests me, a sort of bent glass tube behind a display case, and I press the button to summon an employee. An older man walks over in a dirty grey shirt, baseball cap and denim shorts. he asks if I want the item, but I changed my mind and say I only accidentally pressed the button. as I walk away, my friend presses it too. the employee walks to him, and his head twists all the way around, and a different face on the back of his head talks to him in japanese. I look to a hallway and see another person has entered, an overweight woman dressed like an Egyptian pharaoh. her fingers are bent in an impossible shape, like the claws of a bird or the body of a spider, but perfectly round such that they could cradle an apple in their resting position. I get the impression these people are human mascots.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/dream/redwoods</guid></item><item><title>on juice</title><link>https://ivysly.com/blog/on-juice</link><description>&lt;p&gt;put screenshake in your game. screenshake is the secret to a game that &lt;em&gt;feels good&lt;/em&gt;. if you don&amp;rsquo;t put it in your game, your game may not &lt;em&gt;feel good&lt;/em&gt;. the purpose of a game is to &lt;em&gt;feel good&lt;/em&gt;. we have perfected the formula to making a game &lt;em&gt;feel good&lt;/em&gt;. if you follow this formula your game will &lt;em&gt;feel good&lt;/em&gt; and thus it will be good. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;video games are just interfaces for sensation. we have extracted sweet sensation from pesky semantics. there&amp;rsquo;s no more need for intention. screen shake no longer has to convey &lt;em&gt;impact&lt;/em&gt;. it doesn&amp;rsquo;t need to convey anything. just do whatever you want. we are currently developing a game that is nothing but shaking and squishing and sloshing. baddies flash white when you swat them but also the goodies and everything else even if you don&amp;rsquo;t swat them. particle effects. stop thinking about it and start feeling about it. we are looking into haptic ecstacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;making a game is the real game. you need snapping and fizzing and swishing and zapping. i don&amp;rsquo;t care where you put it. put it anywhere. it&amp;rsquo;s a fucking &lt;em&gt;video game&lt;/em&gt;. did you know that in 2024 the games industry alone pulled in $184 billion dollars? why would you waste your time thinking when there is money to be made? look at all the other games around you: they are squishy and huggy and cozy and every time you do anything the game rewards you with an outpouring of sickeningly sweet &lt;em&gt;juice&lt;/em&gt;. your game needs to be sexual, it needs to simulate orgasm, and you need kids to buy it. what the fuck else are you making these for?&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 29 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/blog/on-juice</guid></item><item><title>Rain World</title><link>https://ivysly.com/reviews/rain-world</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Uugghhhhh it&amp;rsquo;s so good. Really masterfully designed in how it gets you exploring both the environments and game mechanics, though it can be cryptic to its own detriment. The non-player-creatures stand out as highly believable, unsettlingly real animals that act in unpredictable but natural ways. it&amp;rsquo;s also hard to fathom how such a small team could achieve such heights in visual (gorgeous, semi-procedural environment art) and audio (truly creepy and strange creature noises and tasteful, huge ambient soundscapes that are admittedly a little hampered by the sort of forgettable soundtrack—i think a stronger choice would have been no music at all with a different method of conveying that you are e.g. about to be eaten by some kind of juiced up crocodile) design. I really was not prepared for the atmosphere of this game. it&amp;rsquo;s really a treat.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Rain World knows that it is a simple game. you are not rewarded for exploration with a double jump or bigger muscles to throw rocks harder but with cool new places encrusted with cool new layers of cool new types of crust, and with cool weird new organisms that make you squirm with disgust(ed delight). Getting eaten by something new in a new, exotic, concrete bolgia is its own reward. Rain World is not a horror game but it is scary in the way that real life is scary. anything can happen and you don&amp;rsquo;t know what will until it does. even then, you can only prepare for what you know has happened before. Rain World is not above surprising you with a new type of dying. it&amp;rsquo;s bold but it works because it knows what it wants to be and how all its constituent parts should be in order to meet that goal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the major problem with Rain World is just that it can be very hard to tell what you are really supposed to do or where to go, and the game doesn&amp;rsquo;t really account for this much. the slow pace of the platforming and level layouts can make experimentation annoying, especially while trying to avoid death by random predator or just flopping off a cliff. it&amp;rsquo;s difficult to remember how to get around, even with the map, which has been purposefully restricted in utility. maybe I am a new school gamer, but any time i need to whip out the pencil and paper to remember which areas link where (which I have got very close to doing, I still don&amp;rsquo;t fucken remember how to get to half the map) I think as a designer you have failed unless the integrity of the game is built around that, and I still probably wouldn&amp;rsquo;t play even Wizardry without an automap. I understand the intention of mystery and letting the player discover things, but I think some of the discoveries in Rain World are more frustrating than satisfying (I could have done X the whole time?).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I happily recommend Rain World but please know that you are looking at a very specific type of game that can be frustrating to some people. It feels in some sense like a game for game developers. I just wanna take it apart and look at its insides, and those of the people who made it.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 12 Jul 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/reviews/rain-world</guid></item><item><title>on scope creep</title><link>https://ivysly.com/blog/on-scope-creep</link><description>&lt;p&gt;two game studios behind two highly anticipated games announced those games&amp;rsquo; cancellations within the last couple weeks, those being indie studio Tendershoot&amp;rsquo;s Dreamsettler, the ambitious sequel to interactive fiction/internet simulator masterpiece Hypnospace Outlaw, and Riot-funded Hypixel&amp;rsquo;s Hytale, a Minecraftlike that was in development for over &lt;em&gt;seven years&lt;/em&gt;. the major problem both of these studios cited was unchecked ambition (a desire to make the &lt;em&gt;best game ever&lt;/em&gt;) and thus building these giant, untenable concepts and systems that ultimately demanded too much from the people working on them. the Vision can be so intoxicating it destroys any chance of a person actually making it real.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I want to give an extended answer to this question my friend asked me:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;do you get scope creep feelings? how do you process them if so?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;to quickly outline the term: scope creep is a process by which the hugeness of a project grows and grows out of control, until it is no longer workable, as the people on the project are repeatedly struck with an insidious brainworm: &amp;ldquo;the project would be way cooler if we just added this one thing&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;. eventually the project becomes a clusterfuck of mostly cool new things that suffocate a now unrecognizable Core Vision, and often it is never finished. this has happened to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this blog post makes a lot of assumptions. one is that you are or you know a game developer or some kind of artist or craftsman or architect who works in a medium that requires a lot of time and effort to produce a single finished work, and you do care that these works generally get finished and maybe even shared with the world. if you&amp;rsquo;re someone who is cool with taking your time, not worried about the finished product, and just making yourself happy adding a bunch of little things to a big thing, keep doing that. ignore any advice you know doesn&amp;rsquo;t apply to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;do you get scope creep feelings?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I get scope creep feelings. I deal with them all the time, for every project. I don&amp;rsquo;t think they are avoidable. obviously we all want to make the best game ever. but the game in your head will never exist, so you have to compromise with reality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;there&amp;rsquo;s always stuff that gets cut in the idea stage, stuff I&amp;rsquo;ll rip out of a game fully finished, and, in-between, a whole spectrum of scaling back cool ideas that are unjustified uses of time and effort, time and effort which could be better spent realizing the Core Vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;how do you process them if so?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;most games are about killing dudes. Given the right context, killing dudes is very cathartic. why shouldn&amp;rsquo;t that be true for killing ideas, assets, code, features, etc? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;throwing things out doesn&amp;rsquo;t have to be a bad thing. it&amp;rsquo;s a part of life. when I started learning in adulthood how to cook, I threw tons of food away. maybe because i made something inedible, or i bought too much and it went bad. over time I began to develop a positive relationship with throwing food away, because it meant I was cooking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;after a short period of grieving the cool new thing I won&amp;rsquo;t be using in a game anymore, I find it easy to focus on the positives. there are plenty of advantages to cutting out a feature in a game. the most obvious and practical thing is that you reduce the workload for yourself. lower workload means you can spend more time on the stuff that really matters. consider all the loads of clusterfuck games that &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; release and still suck because they couldn&amp;rsquo;t reign it in and focus on the Core Vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have developed this mindset over years and years of fatally overscoping. I started programming in 2015 with the goal of making games. each project was ridiculous. one of my first projects wanted to be similar to Cataclysm DDA. a 2018 project was supposed to be a Smash Bros—like. there are so many examples like this. I didn&amp;rsquo;t finish &lt;em&gt;my first game&lt;/em&gt; until 2021 (six years of nothing!!!) when I began working with &lt;a href="https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php"&gt;PICO-8&lt;/a&gt;, a game development environment that intentionally imposes &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; strict limitations on the developer, and it forced me to keep my scope reasonable. I finished &lt;a href="https://ivysly.com/games/grippy"&gt;that game&lt;/a&gt; in about a month.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;some people feel like their time is wasted when they reach a dead end and they have to backtrack, that it is a negative outcome to be avoided. many are led to a scarily prevalent sunk-cost feeling and grow attached to bad ideas just because they fear scaling back so much. I just don&amp;rsquo;t think this is right. &lt;em&gt;backward progress is still progress&lt;/em&gt;. it&amp;rsquo;s surely not as efficient as realizing your vision of the game perfectly from start to finish, but nobody can actually do that. realizing you&amp;rsquo;ve scope crept and scaling it back is a natural part of working on a complex system. it is just a thick branch in a tree of mistakes—you don&amp;rsquo;t keep a wrong algorithm in your code, you take it out and replace it with something else or nothing at all. you don&amp;rsquo;t leave in typos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;when scope creep happens you just have to focus on what you can get out it. what assets can you reuse? what ideas can you extract? if nothing else, what did you learn? I don&amp;rsquo;t remember a time when the answer to all these questions was &amp;ldquo;nothing&amp;rdquo;, so I posit that it&amp;rsquo;s never truly a waste. the Hytale developers will move on having if nothing else learned a very important lesson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is important to note that I&amp;rsquo;m not against adding easter eggs and fun stuff just because. that&amp;rsquo;s what games are made of. I just think a game designer can benefit from weighing the time and effort cost of adding (or keeping) a feature with the amount of substance it adds to the game, how much it helps to complement and complete the Vision.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;the process&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;recently I posted this to bsky:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ivysly.com/post/3lrgs4kpkms2e"&gt;&amp;gt; I see good indie devs burn themselves out on huge projects and suddenly come out of hiatus with a little game that is way better and more focused than their prison opus and every time I want to scream: just do those games&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I followed up with: &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ivysly.com/post/3lrgu4en5c22l"&gt;&amp;gt; don&amp;rsquo;t make a big game until for you it&amp;rsquo;s a small game&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;and I want to elaborate a little bit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;first off, I think if you know what you want to do, you should do that. if you are willing to do what it takes, and you can afford to do it, then you should make the ambitious game of your dreams. I&amp;rsquo;m only asking people to consider what they want, if they haven&amp;rsquo;t already, and if they are willing to really work for it, and if they really know that they truly are willing, and so on. but I know I don&amp;rsquo;t really need to say that to them, because the people who know what they want don&amp;rsquo;t need me to tell them what they want. that leaves the rest of you suckers. especially those devs in question burning themselves out on big games—I only want to suggest an alternative that can be just as fun and much lower stakes. I have outlined a 2 step process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;step 1. when you are deciding on a game concept, it can be difficult to know how big of a game you can make. I have a radical solution: look way, WAY smaller than you think you need to. unless you are an absolute newbie, there is definitely &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; you know you &lt;em&gt;can&lt;/em&gt; make without question. maybe that&amp;rsquo;s pong, or even breakout. something of which you can envision the entire structure before starting any work. 100% confidence only. make that thing. if you are an absolute newbie, or you otherwise don&amp;rsquo;t have 100% confidence in pong, skip to step 2.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;step 2. when you are done making that thing, it&amp;rsquo;s time to do something completely antithetical to this blog post so far: start up a project with a big vague idea, experiment, add whatever you want without any thought to maintainability or even finishing the game. if you are the aforementioned absolute newbie, this is where you make pong instead. you (probably) will not finish the game, but I think this is the best way to safely push yourself without heartbreak. it will give you an idea of what you are capable of, so when you return to step 1, you will notice that you are able to envision a slightly bigger &lt;em&gt;entire game&lt;/em&gt; than you were last time. maybe substantially bigger. that&amp;rsquo;s it. return to step 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;this is the process I have come up with &lt;em&gt;accidentally&lt;/em&gt; over the last few years. accidentally because step 2 was always supposed to be step 1. it was always a feeling of, &amp;ldquo;okay, enough with these little projects, I&amp;rsquo;m going to make my opus, my Real Game. this time I can really do it.&amp;rdquo; then I noodle around for months and drop the thing because either it&amp;rsquo;s just too hard to implement the big ideas by myself or I just don&amp;rsquo;t have a cohesive enough idea to hold together such a big scope. subsequently, when I go back to making small games, I realize that the biggest game I&amp;rsquo;m 100% confident in making just got a little bigger.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have been, entirely by mistake, employing what I now believe to be a highly effective strategy for self-learning and improving my skills, and maybe even for eventually getting to making that big game my kid self always wanted to make. I present it, modified to reduce suffering, for anyone to try.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;ethics of the opus&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;something i feel is important and kind of overlooked is that games take a really long time to make, when compared to most other forms of art. the barrier to entry is already really high. a 3 month timeline is on the low end for a finished game, outside of time-constrained game jam challenges which don&amp;rsquo;t really work as a real development strategy for &amp;ldquo;full size&amp;rdquo; games. I estimate most indie devs working on long term (non-gamejam/tutorial) projects are spending about a year or two. imagine if it took that long to write a single song, or paint a single picture. we are at a disadvantage in that way to composers or painters, because we only get so many two-year periods we can make games before we die or otherwise lose the ability. I suggest that it is inhumane to expect each other to meet a standard like that. life is very short for a game developer. we have to be much more picky about how we spend our time than a painter or a songwriter. we have much fewer chances to find our voices. this is, I think, maybe the most important reason for one to consider making smaller games.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;walking up the steps at the train station, slowly. my body has been put back together but I&amp;rsquo;m unrecognizable. I look like they only haphazardly put my skin back on. I feel like the worst version of RoboCop. I have no mouth anymore, and my hands are little plastic toys that can make a finger gun gesture. my mouth protects my organs, so I need to protect my mouth. I walk by a woman in a similar condition. I make finger guns at her. as I walk the reality of my situation sets in, and it makes me very sad.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/dream/train-station</guid></item><item><title>daydreaming with lua</title><link>https://ivysly.com/blog/daydreaming-with-lua</link><description>&lt;p&gt;i think many programmers are conquerors. they want to bend reality to their will. to this end, making a software is an intense power fantasy, one where the programmer is given a problem and full control over a system to solve that problem, leveraging the unimaginable algorithmic power of the machine to obliterate tasks that would have taken human computers lifetimes of effort. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;in some capacity this is true also for creatives and really all people—there is an essential equivalence between making art and the process of daydreaming (the latter of which being a universal human experience) as commonly a form of wish-fulfillment. to develop a video game, i entertain both the power fantasy of programming and the wish-fulfillment of creative writing in a single process, to the immense satisfaction of my ego, and video games themselves achieve the highest potential for wish-fulfillment of any artistic medium.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;at the beginning of 2024 i made a resolution to ditch Godot. I had used it for 6 years or so, and for much of that time i held so much optimism for it and its future. but years of big and little issues wore me down, and finally i decided it was time to move on. i was done with doing things the Godot Way.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;instead i was going to build my own engine in FNA, a fork of XNA similar to Monogame, which uses the C# programming language. i really did try to do this, and i spent several months on the foundation for a 2d engine, but what i found is that C# and FNA became a sort of creative prison for me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;you see the problem is that i can&amp;rsquo;t honestly describe myself as a &lt;em&gt;software developer&lt;/em&gt; but instead as an intuitive &lt;em&gt;game artist&lt;/em&gt;, who prefers freedom of expression without regard to the convention or maintenance needed of business software. what i need is rapid iteration, to unconsciously feel the impacts of tiny tweaks to the sensations of a game, not theorizing and calculating large swaths of changes all at once and waiting for the program to be &amp;ldquo;correct&amp;rdquo; before continuing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;C# is not made for artists, it is made for businesses. this is true for the majority of general-purpose programming languages. C# is bureaucratic and cold, tough but fair. it&amp;rsquo;s not supposed to be a fun language because it is supposed to be a tool. it is the reflection of its creators who belong to a culture i reject as inhumane, thus its philosophy. so i have concluded that FNA just doesn&amp;rsquo;t meet the needs of the sole &lt;em&gt;game artist&lt;/em&gt; and could, worse, be actively harmful to artists who don&amp;rsquo;t know any better. programming languages are not just one-way communication, they necessarily communicate to you how you ought to think about data and procedures, and in the case of the game artist this means your creative output.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;the fact is, i wanted to try &lt;a href="https://love2d.org/"&gt;LÖVE&lt;/a&gt; long before i was ever interested in FNA. but something scared me about Lua, the simple, dynamic, interpreted programming language used by LÖVE. to me its simplicity hid intimidating depth. i had used it once before but i never really took the time to understand it. metatables, weird keywords, global magic methods—this was all very alien, 1-indexed arrays the least of my concerns. but i knew, deeply, even before my doomed tryst with C#, LÖVE was what was missing in my heart. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i have learned since i started using it that Lua is more than just pleasant to write. i should have been tipped off by the name and brand of the LÖVE framework: soft colors, rounded edges, a sort of pneumatic, inviting atmosphere to its website, which playfully warns that its community &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;sometimes gets too friendly&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt;. all the clues are there. even the community-made libraries follow this theme, often explicitly; you will quickly find packages with names like &lt;em&gt;makelove&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;love bone&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;quickie&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;moan&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;hump&lt;/em&gt;, and yes, &lt;em&gt;hardon collider&lt;/em&gt;. this kind of thing might throw some people off, but after writing &lt;a href="https://ivysly.com/games/famulus"&gt;my second Lua-powered game&lt;/a&gt;, i have to say:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;i understand.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Lua is a deeply erotic programming language. is this absurd to say? it is inviting and warm. there are no rules with Lua. it is not your boss but an equal and a companion. Lua says, &amp;ldquo;do what you want with me&amp;rdquo;. it is surprising but fluid. debugging is more feeling than rigor. even the name is feminine and flirtatious. it is everything that C# is not. Lua i come home to.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;sex is sort of like plugging in. despite having little in the way of modern package management, Lua allows the programmer to easily incorporate external library code unaltered, even with vast differences in structure, because Lua is highly polymorphic in both a mathematical and biological sense—that is, one API might be completely unrecognizable to the other, but you can still plug in. you could call that chemistry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;i must recognize that the source of my daydream is the subconscious. it is impossible to ignore that my desire to make art is deeply entangled in the immediate, libidinal drive of the id, and barely held enough together by my ego to result in coherent output. is it absurd to model and encourage this with my tools? Lua is as satisfying in this way as you can get in the form of a programming language (see also Lisp) because what it allows you to do maps directly to the innermost desires of the human psyche. Lua was made for pleasure and play. while this may not be a good fit for the anti-human culture of business software, i think the benefit to creatives is by now self-evident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;game artists are in a weird place where expression is steeped in procedure. art techniques are often formulaic, but the foundation of the art of programming is formula. this is where we make little prisons for ourselves. i would think the goal of the game artist is to instead build a bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/blog/daydreaming-with-lua</guid></item><item><title>Brothers</title><link>https://ivysly.com/dream/brothers</link><description>&lt;p&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s revealed I had two brothers who were given up for adoption at birth. one of them was named David Larry and the other was named David B.

&lt;p&gt;Antonblast feels too easy and too difficult at the same time in a way that kind of just turns out boring. the best sections are some of the set pieces in a few level sections and boss fights, they are absolutely next level and what I want to see from more indie devs in the future: economic, cinematic gameplay that plays on existing mechanics while providing a unique self-contained spectacle. those parts are just too far apart.

There is sometimes little difference between winning and losing. Navigating its strangely industrial corridors is haunting and tense, and this tension is further enhanced by the game&amp;rsquo;s unsettling sound design and music. This is a very beautiful game by all metrics, one of the best looking games I&amp;rsquo;ve seen for the Saturn (which is the version I&amp;rsquo;d recommend playing) complete with absolutely dope CGI FMV sequences.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The game really is quite FUN, but sadly just a little too brutal. It has an interesting and tactical item system and unique enemies with different strategies, and the combat feels better than you&amp;rsquo;d expect, but you can very easily find yourself stuck in a run that is doomed to fail. And since the character controller has such sluggish movement, losing a run can mean sacrificing an hour or two for absolutely no progression in the main story. Roguelikes are at their best when you can play them at your own pace. Baroque&amp;rsquo;s moment-to-moment gameplay is just too slow for the rather interesting strategy game beneath it. On the other hand, the slower pace fits the atmosphere perfectly. There is some dissonance between Baroque&amp;rsquo;s intention to be a narratively substantial RPG and its commitment to traditional roguelike trappings, and that can be frustrating as someone who is invested but not enough to play the game for hours at a time just for breadcrumbs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Still, there is no other game that feels the way Baroque does, and despite its obvious borrowings from games like King&amp;rsquo;s Field and Mystery Dungeon, this is a game that has no substitute - not even the remake for the PS2 and Wii. Ultimately you have nothing to lose playing through the dungeon once or twice, and I recommend doing so just for the wicked vibes alone.

I only wish it weren&amp;rsquo;t so easy, and that I played it as a kid. play co-op if you can.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 11 May 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/reviews/kirby-super-star-ultra</guid></item><item><title>Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</title><link>https://ivysly.com/reviews/castlevania-symphony-of-the-night</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s cool that everything explodes when you kill it. The boss fights are hit &amp;amp; miss, with all of them having very nice art. Sadly the level design is agonizing and largely consists of long corridors full of the same enemies. The second half of the game&amp;rsquo;s map is even worse: you are constantly required to switch to and from a very slow flying state to access new areas, as it was obviously not designed to be traversed normally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fucking around in the inventory menu gets increasingly tedious because they couldn&amp;rsquo;t have a sane item system. Most items just serve to clutter your inventory. This game suffers greatly from completely pointless RPG mechanics that detract from the entertaining parts of the game. You are drip-fed small servings of fun between long stretches of boring nothing, well hidden by satisfying bells and whistles that make you feel like something is happening when it&amp;rsquo;s not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It is hard to shake the feeling that the developers wanted to stretch out the play time as long as possible, but they didn&amp;rsquo;t want to bother actually making it worth playing for that long. It&amp;rsquo;s a waste of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Castlevania: Symphony of the Night is what happens when you decide to add everything to a game. It&amp;rsquo;s worth playing for the presentation alone, but one shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be ashamed if they&amp;rsquo;ve had enough before it&amp;rsquo;s over.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 26 Apr 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/reviews/castlevania-symphony-of-the-night</guid></item><item><title>Metroid Dread</title><link>https://ivysly.com/reviews/metroid-dread</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This game likes to make you feel like you&amp;rsquo;re in charge of the exploring when in reality it pushes you through fairly linear environments. Less player freedom but that&amp;rsquo;s not necessarily a bad thing. The robot chases were a cool change of pace. The shooting and jumping and blowing stuff up feels great as usual. I liked the bosses, especially the final boss. The map was kinda too huge for its own good and felt annoying to navigate at times, and much of the enemies being quicktime events felt very boring after a little while.

&lt;p&gt;LIL&amp;rsquo; ZUDDIES come in many shapes and colors. There are over a thousand combinations! Your Zuddy will probably look different from any of your friends&amp;rsquo;! Depending on how well you train it, your Zuddy will evolve into different kinds of special critters, too. Your Zuddy can share its stats and socialize using our new CHATTERFLY technology, allowing Zuddies from across the world to convene right from the comfort of the nest (Not available in web version!!!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your Zuddy will stick around even when you put it away; there&amp;rsquo;s no pausing, even if you close the game! Make sure you check on your Zuddy often, lest you risk losing it to the harsh realities of Nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zuddies have needs. Fun, food, and good health are all important to every Zuddy. Your Zuddy will tell you itself what it needs! Pay attention, because Zuddies are quite fragile, and can only survive a lack of any of these necessities for so long.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zuddies have 3 main stats: Smarts, Strongth, and Training. You can view your Zuddy&amp;rsquo;s stats in the stats📋 menu. Smarts and Strongth affect your Zuddy&amp;rsquo;s performance in games, and all three will help determine what Zuddy your larva will transform into.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the speech 💬 menu! If your Zuddy cries for attention because it is hungry, or if it eats a food it doesn&amp;rsquo;t like, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to praise👍it! Be careful though, because some foods will make your Zuddy sick, depending on the diet. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conversely, if your Zuddy cries for attention, but won&amp;rsquo;t accept food or play, you might need to scold 🚫 it. It may feel bad, but discipline makes for a happy, healthy Zuddy! A highly trained Zuddy will also be less likely to cause trouble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medicine 💉 is great for restoring the health of a sick Zuddy, but use it sparingly! Not only is it very unpleasant, it is also quite hard on the Zuddy physiology, causing sleepiness and reducing the Zuddy&amp;rsquo;s Strongth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes your Zuddy will be dormant, whether it is sleeping or in the pupal stage. Don&amp;rsquo;t fret! Just wait it out. You can always come back later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Made in just under two weeks, including all art, sounds, and music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apologies in advance: this game runs like crap. It also crashes for some people. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why. I&amp;rsquo;M SORRY! &lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 29 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/games/deep</guid></item><item><title>Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup</title><link>https://ivysly.com/reviews/dcss</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup puts the Playing Game in Role-Playing Game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s the best game ever made. Ok, not really. But good luck finding another strategy game that offers the same level of tactical depth without any of the boring parts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup simultaneously remains a capital T &amp;ldquo;Traditional Roguelike&amp;rdquo; and utterly breaks the mold of tradition by actually caring about the player. There is no grinding. There are no tedious, multi-step rituals to accomplish basic tasks in the name of fluff. It is pure tactics. Everything that is not tactics is taken out. If something is not tactics and they can&amp;rsquo;t take it out, it is automated. It does not require a google search or wiki to play (and beat).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also it&amp;rsquo;s free and you can play it &lt;a href="https://crawl.develz.org/"&gt;in your browser&lt;/a&gt;. You have no excuse!&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/reviews/dcss</guid></item><item><title>Kero Blaster</title><link>https://ivysly.com/reviews/kero-blaster</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This is a great little run &amp;amp; gun that does little to innovate but nails the execution. That&amp;rsquo;s all that really matters anyway. Good study material for level designers. It looks nice and the music &amp;amp; sound design is great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is some crust in staying so true to its roots. The control scheme is pretty awkward. Switching weapons is a pain, and sometimes turning around while shooting doesn&amp;rsquo;t work the way you&amp;rsquo;d expect. You also have to retread the entire level on a game-over, which can get a little annoying in the later levels (which are relatively long) but the game is only about 2-3 hours anyway so this is hardly an issue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line is that you should play Kero Blaster if you&amp;rsquo;ve ever enjoyed a game where you shoot a gun and &amp;ldquo;side scroll&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 06 Mar 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/reviews/kero-blaster</guid></item><item><title>Minecraft</title><link>https://ivysly.com/reviews/minecraft</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s boring. It has severe pacing issues. The challenges presented are more tedious than stimulating. The &amp;ldquo;RPG&amp;rdquo; elements are basically non-existent. The combat is terrible. Building is creative but also completely unrewarding. Minecraft doesn&amp;rsquo;t know what it wants to be and accomplishes nothing well, except that initial feeling of awesome scale that quickly turns to disappointment when you realize there is nothing to do in its infinitely huge world.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 20 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/reviews/minecraft</guid></item><item><title>Your Only Move Is HUSTLE</title><link>https://ivysly.com/games/your-only-move-is-hustle</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Your Only Move Is HUSTLE is an online, turn-based fighting game and superpowered fight scene simulator.

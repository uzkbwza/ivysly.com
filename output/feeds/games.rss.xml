&lt;p&gt;the game saves your progress, so if you get stuck, you can hit escape/start and then press the continue button to restart the level. i am aware of at least one point in the game where you can get stuck&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;controls are arrow keys&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 14 Dec 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/games/fishbone</guid></item><item><title>Evil Egg</title><link>https://ivysly.com/games/evil-egg</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Evil Egg was an ecstatic twin-stick nightmare known for its brutal shooting action and intense audiovisual effects. Infinite horrors tear apart a world of little green men, the only hope an errant hatchling.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The last known Evil Egg arcade cabinet to remain was recovered in Eugene, Oregon, found in a state of extreme disrepair. This digital release is a faithful emulation of the original hardware, made possible by a restoration effort led by a small team of dedicated preservationists. The private collector responsible for the machine&amp;rsquo;s donation has asked to remain anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;this game is pretty derivative but perhaps fun. the primary goal for this project was to ensure that my new game engine (built with LÖVE) is complete enough to power an actual game, even if it is a small one.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 22 Dec 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/games/famulus</guid></item><item><title>Carpet Gallery</title><link>https://ivysly.com/games/carpet-gallery</link><description>&lt;p&gt;An endless walker with procedural scenery and objects.

&lt;p&gt;LIL&amp;rsquo; ZUDDIES come in many shapes and colors. There are over a thousand combinations! Your Zuddy will probably look different from any of your friends&amp;rsquo;! Depending on how well you train it, your Zuddy will evolve into different kinds of special critters, too. Your Zuddy can share its stats and socialize using our new CHATTERFLY technology, allowing Zuddies from across the world to convene right from the comfort of the nest (Not available in web version!!!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Tips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Your Zuddy will stick around even when you put it away; there&amp;rsquo;s no pausing, even if you close the game! Make sure you check on your Zuddy often, lest you risk losing it to the harsh realities of Nature.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zuddies have needs. Fun, food, and good health are all important to every Zuddy. Your Zuddy will tell you itself what it needs! Pay attention, because Zuddies are quite fragile, and can only survive a lack of any of these necessities for so long.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Zuddies have 3 main stats: Smarts, Strongth, and Training. You can view your Zuddy&amp;rsquo;s stats in the stats📋 menu. Smarts and Strongth affect your Zuddy&amp;rsquo;s performance in games, and all three will help determine what Zuddy your larva will transform into.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Use the speech 💬 menu! If your Zuddy cries for attention because it is hungry, or if it eats a food it doesn&amp;rsquo;t like, don&amp;rsquo;t forget to praise👍it! Be careful though, because some foods will make your Zuddy sick, depending on the diet. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Conversely, if your Zuddy cries for attention, but won&amp;rsquo;t accept food or play, you might need to scold 🚫 it. It may feel bad, but discipline makes for a happy, healthy Zuddy! A highly trained Zuddy will also be less likely to cause trouble.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Medicine 💉 is great for restoring the health of a sick Zuddy, but use it sparingly! Not only is it very unpleasant, it is also quite hard on the Zuddy physiology, causing sleepiness and reducing the Zuddy&amp;rsquo;s Strongth.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Sometimes your Zuddy will be dormant, whether it is sleeping or in the pupal stage. Don&amp;rsquo;t fret! Just wait it out. You can always come back later.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;LIL&amp;rsquo; ZUDDY was made in 16 days for Sewerjam 3.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 26 Nov 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/games/lil-zuddy</guid></item><item><title>Blood Golf 2023</title><link>https://ivysly.com/games/blood-golf</link><description>&lt;p&gt;BLOOD GOLF is a PVP or PVE golf-em-up where your target is the other player. Use powerups, map knowledge, and, most importantly, elegant combat-golf technique to turn your enemies into a fine mist or send them past the stratosphere. Has local multiplayer, or you can fight against the CPU.

&lt;p&gt;Made in just under two weeks, including all art, sounds, and music.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apologies in advance: this game runs like crap. It also crashes for some people. I don&amp;rsquo;t know why.

I started working on this game in September 2022 and a few months later it released on Steam and changed my life forever.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 02 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/games/your-only-move-is-hustle</guid></item><item><title>No Reservations</title><link>https://ivysly.com/games/no-reservations</link><description>&lt;p&gt;High-octane fast-paced top down shooter plus &amp;ldquo;dating&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;sim&amp;rdquo;. Take your girl out for pizza. Made entirely in 8 days by me and &lt;a href="https://humanisred.itch.io/"&gt;HIS&lt;/a&gt; for GoedWare Game Jam.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 12 Jun 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/games/no-reservations</guid></item><item><title>Super Misfire or: One Gun To Shoot Them All</title><link>https://ivysly.com/games/supermisfire</link><description>&lt;p&gt;🏆 #1 for &amp;ldquo;Fun&amp;rdquo; in ludum dare 49 compo&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my take on the “unstable” theme for Ludum Dare 49. You operate a malfunctioning quantum supergun, which shoots things it probably isn’t supposed to. Achieve superiority over your friends by travelling further through the Dungeon of Enemies than they can.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every bullet you can shoot is unique, and all have the capacity to save your life or spell your death in their own ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only available to play in-browser on itch.io. Maybe I&amp;rsquo;ll put it here later.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/games/supermisfire</guid></item><item><title>Defy Godwin</title><link>https://ivysly.com/games/defy-godwin</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Defy Godwin is a comedic work of interactive fiction and a realistic forum simulator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Godwin’s Law: As a discussion on the Internet goes on, the probability of a comparison to Nazis or Adolf Hitler approaches 1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Amidst a war of rhetoric, you are but an internet forum moderator - the impartial paramedic of a digital battlefield. With a new corporate leadership buying out your home base @ Hyperlink Heaven, your mission is now to appease advertisers by preventing users from invoking Nazism (and thus Godwin’s Law). Slap and exile in your vain attempt to stifle their discussions’ inevitable conclusion. Use your wit and read between the lines to end these battles before they even start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This game was made with personal friends who contributed the majority of the writing and prefer to remain anonymous.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 30 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/games/defy-godwin</guid></item><item><title>Leg Frogs</title><link>https://ivysly.com/games/leg-frogs</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A quick little game I made for a jam.

It was too ambitious so I never finished it, but I credit it with a multitude of lessons learned. You can play with all the content I made for it, but there will probably never be more.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sat, 04 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/games/rocket-sword</guid></item><item><title>GRiPPY</title><link>https://ivysly.com/games/grippy</link><description>&lt;p&gt;GRiPPY is a hardcore, subversive platformer for the PICO-8 system about climbing through a mysterious underground complex and overcoming hostile terrain. You play as Grippy, a creature with very, very strong arms, but no legs. You must travel by hurling yourself across the world and latching onto anything you can grip. This was my first PICO-8 game and my first finished game.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Controls&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;O/X (z/x on keyboard): reach out a hand and grab &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;left/right: rotate aim angle &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;down (hold): aiming mode; reach without grabbing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;up: hop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can change your control settings in the pause menu.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/games/grippy</guid></item></channel></rss>

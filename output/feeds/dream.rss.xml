Verdict was that they were not terrible at designing rides and games. They had this &amp;ldquo;key&amp;rdquo; system where you&amp;rsquo;d earn these strange items by completing rides and learning scientology related lessons. they snuck these keys into real video games (one I remember was Myst) and they had their own little motif that played when you found one. they weren&amp;rsquo;t really keys but a sort of oblong red polyhedron with a golden wireframe shape extruding from the long end, like an abstract key already stuck in a lock.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the rides near the beginning (which to us was the end, as we went backward through the park) was the &amp;ldquo;gay straight bar&amp;rdquo;. it was like a caged  carousel with a bar in the center. they had an advertisement playing, with shitty 90s advertisement hip hop, and it explained the ride. the song went &amp;ldquo;gay bar!&amp;rdquo; and the riders booed. then it went &amp;ldquo;straight bar!&amp;rdquo; and the riders cheered, followed by a repeating &amp;ldquo;gay bar straight bar gay bar straight bar &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; as the ride sped up the bargoers all stood up and held hands. it struck me as unusually progressive for a 90s theme park ride to address such topics&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 04 Jan 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/dream/scientology</guid></item><item><title>Bag</title><link>https://ivysly.com/dream/bag</link><description>&lt;p&gt;we accidentally put a plastic bag full of food over Dennis&amp;rsquo; nose and mouth and leave it there for hours. he seems fine, but when I take it off he telepathically communicates to me that it was the most painful thing he has ever experienced&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/dream/bag</guid></item><item><title>Downtown</title><link>https://ivysly.com/dream/downtown</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m downtown, and the military is here. a woman is doing bag checks on the side walk. I walk the other way.  army men in tanks are driving down the street. there&amp;rsquo;s a staircase up to the market, I take it. one of them stop me and do a pat down. they ask to look in my mouth, and find some plastic shit I&amp;rsquo;m anxiously chewing on. this confounds them and they consider if I&amp;rsquo;m on drugs, but ultimately let me go.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 16 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/dream/downtown</guid></item><item><title>Ducklings</title><link>https://ivysly.com/dream/ducklings</link><description>&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s a really cold night so I go out to check on the ducklings. They have blankets on top of their brooder plates and for some reason multi colored fairy lights are all around their enclosure. I notice one of the brooder plates fell off after Betty shows me and quacks.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 13 Nov 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/dream/ducklings</guid></item><item><title>Redwoods</title><link>https://ivysly.com/dream/redwoods</link><description>&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re in Northern California, at the redwoods. I&amp;rsquo;m with my friend who is a Japanese salaryman on vacation. We&amp;rsquo;re on a dirt road surrounded by massive beautiful sequoias. Nearby is the largest monster truck ramp in the world. My friend suggests we jump it, but I think we should start with a smaller ramp.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a hardware store. It&amp;rsquo;s just me and my friend. I see something that interests me, a sort of bent glass tube behind a display case, and I press the button to summon an employee. An older man walks over in a dirty grey shirt, baseball cap and denim shorts. he asks if I want the item, but I changed my mind and say I only accidentally pressed the button. as I walk away, my friend presses it too. the employee walks to him, and his head twists all the way around, and a different face on the back of his head talks to him in japanese. I look to a hallway and see another person has entered, an overweight woman dressed like an Egyptian pharaoh. her fingers are bent in an impossible shape, like the claws of a bird or the body of a spider, but perfectly round such that they could cradle an apple in their resting position. I get the impression these people are human mascots.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 05 Sep 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/dream/redwoods</guid></item><item><title>Barn</title><link>https://ivysly.com/dream/barn</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in a barn&amp;hellip; it&amp;rsquo;s dark. all I remember about this part.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in a car as a passenger, on the highway. in front of me is another car, and a famous actor is getting it on with a woman in the back seat. the person I&amp;rsquo;m with sees this and is consumed by jealousy, as she thought they had something special.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I sat down to watch an old movie from my childhood (something like the wizard of oz though I don&amp;rsquo;t think it was that, nor any real movie) and the moment it started playing I began weeping and couldn&amp;rsquo;t stop, I was so moved by nostalgia.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 13 May 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/dream/barn</guid></item><item><title>Colony</title><link>https://ivysly.com/dream/colony</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Can&amp;rsquo;t leave shelter because there&amp;rsquo;s a giant insect bird that will swoop down and eviscerate us.

I take my phone and start to record its landing spot. it&amp;rsquo;s glowing faintly red. I hear screams and explosions and look up, still recording, to see dozens more shooting stars colliding into each other and raining down chunks of rock. I see another giant Earth in the sky. I run back into the hotel and the staff are ushering people somewhere. a man is crying and threatening suicide.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Mon, 07 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/dream/shooting-star</guid></item><item><title>Footsteps</title><link>https://ivysly.com/dream/footsteps</link><description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m in a spacious, plain looking building like a school or a hospital. I&amp;rsquo;ve got my field mic and I&amp;rsquo;m recording my own footsteps. I noticed some orchestral music was interfering with the recording, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the source. I end up in a concert hall with the seats like bleachers in how steeply they ascend, nobody is in them. the whole concert hall is empty but the music is quite loud, and I&amp;rsquo;m trying to find the source. I walk up the stairs and I find at the top of them a door to another completely full concert hall where the orchestra is playing very loud.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Thu, 03 Apr 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/dream/footsteps</guid></item><item><title>VW Beetle</title><link>https://ivysly.com/dream/vw-beetle</link><description>&lt;p&gt;Traded in my car for a pink VW beetle installed with a red haired hologram anime girl.

&lt;p&gt;walking up the steps at the train station, slowly. my body has been put back together but I&amp;rsquo;m unrecognizable. I look like they only haphazardly put my skin back on. I feel like the worst version of RoboCop. I have no mouth anymore, and my hands are little plastic toys that can make a finger gun gesture. my mouth protects my organs, so I need to protect my mouth. I walk by a woman in a similar condition. I make finger guns at her. as I walk the reality of my situation sets in, and it makes me very sad.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/dream/train-station</guid></item><item><title>Brothers</title><link>https://ivysly.com/dream/brothers</link><description>&lt;p&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s revealed I had two brothers who were given up for adoption at birth. one of them was named David Larry and the other was named David B.

I notice the sliding rocks have an unusual inertia, they don&amp;rsquo;t seem to slow down. later in climbing/parkour gym class I ask how this is possible and nobody can give me an answer, not even the smart kid. everyone just accepts this as a natural property of large rocks.&lt;/p&gt;

A police officer who looks like Kamala Harris viciously beats and interrogates me in an alley. Nearby, I can see over the heads of pedestrians a red or green square indicating whether or not they are positive for COVID. The police officer is one of them. She infects me with the disease, since she is in such close proximity.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 18 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/dream/police-officer</guid></item><item><title>Red Rose</title><link>https://ivysly.com/dream/red-rose</link><description>&lt;p&gt;A masked woman. Another woman cries as new people phase in and out of reality next to her. We live in some kind of mansion with different sections&amp;hellip; I can&amp;rsquo;t remember the significance. There&amp;rsquo;s a large foyer with golden marble walls, floors, pillars. Looks like the bank from the Matrix, but gold. I know the weeping woman cries because the people near her are being taken and moved somewhere else. She further descends into hysteria as a 2-year-old is taken from its mother. I am peeling an egg when I look at the masked woman, and I say, &amp;ldquo;Red rose. Red rose. Red rose.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Sun, 21 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/dream/red-rose</guid></item><item><title>Sidewalk</title><link>https://ivysly.com/dream/sidewalk</link><description>&lt;p&gt;After a false awakening, R and I go on a walk to the nearby market. This time we use the sidewalk on the right of the street instead of our typical left, but I don&amp;rsquo;t find that to be unusual. Whenever I look at her face, I can&amp;rsquo;t remember if she forgot to put on her shirt correctly, uncovering her chest. But when I look at her chest to see, her shirt is on correctly. I chalk this confusion down to not being on my medication.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Tue, 16 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/dream/sidewalk</guid></item><item><title>Children</title><link>https://ivysly.com/dream/children</link><description>&lt;p&gt;This town is in disrepair. On my bike ride my companion and I are accosted. We walk into a family&amp;rsquo;s house. They are very poor, and neglectful of their children. An infant shrieks and squirms in its mother&amp;rsquo;s arms. Another woman walks by and bludgeons it to death with a small hammer or mallet. There are simply so many children in this house. A formless baby, melted inside a teacup giggling. A young boy with no eyes, curious, walking around and puffing a disgusting mist everywhere. There are sacs and boils of substances I can&amp;rsquo;t name. Children who move like worms and bugs, cramped into the bathroom. The boy grabs my arm and doesn&amp;rsquo;t let go.&lt;/p&gt;</description><pubDate>Fri, 10 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ivysly.com/dream/children</guid></item></channel></rss>

Title: Some Dreams I've Gone And Dreamt, And Why You Should Dream, Too

Summary: I preach the benefits of dream journaling, and why I do it. I cherry-pick the highlights of my dream journal, going back a year, with some explanations and commentary, and a couple illustrations. 

I started my dream journal in April of last year. It was a good idea, in 
retrospect.

Dreams are an important tool. They are, as famously documented by Freud, a door
into the subconscious. Dreams are also relevant; even if you haven't recalled a 
single dream in the last 10 years or even in your entire life, it is likely 
you dream nearly every night[1*]. Underlooked, to me, is the potential of dreams
as a source of creative direction. Even during the U.S. lockdown (which, in my 
corner of paradise, has still been going on a year later), I have an ceaseless 
flow of themes and ideas to siphon off into my waking projects.

It is not easy to effectively dream, and like many skills dreaming is a muscle 
you must exercise. The very most important thing you can do to train this muscle 
is to write your dreams down[2*] _as soon as you wake up_. There are other 
things you can do if you have the goal of lucid dreaming (that is, dreaming with
awareness that you are in a dream), but I won't get into that, and I haven't 
been particularly successful with the technique anyway. Dreaming is a lot like
meditation in my opinion, but, unlike meditation, you probably do it every 
night. I would not be surprised if there are similar benefits to dream 
journaling.

Following is a collection of some of my favorite and most memorable dreams, as 
well as some accompanying illustrations. Psychoanalyze me how you will. Nearly 
all of these I remember vividly, even if some are over a year old, simply 
because I wrote them down. Even my very first entry (which is the first listed 
here) is one I can visualize now with as high fidelity as any recent memory of 
waking life, if not higher. 

I post these here partially for archival purposes, but also to give some insight 
into what inspires me and what is going on under the hood of my subconscious.
I don't think my dreams are particularly unique from others'—or, maybe, the
dreams of all people are so unique from one another that I don't consider mine
to be particularly *remarkable* among others'—but I hope this might convince
you why documenting your dreams might be a fun and fulfilling
experience.

> 1: Due to a technicality in the voting process, Gary Coleman is now the president 
of the US. When asked "what he was talking about, Willis," he responded, 
"*please*, come up with a new joke."

This dream happened entirely inside Twitter. Thankfully, this is the first and
last entry of that nature.

> 2: A monkey loses his sponsorship after a climbing injury in the jungle gym. I
explain this to another monkey at the top of a humongous, very thin natural
rock "ledge." The monkey falls off the ledge, then so do I. We fall into the
expansive jungle. I distinctly remember the jungle being in Papua New 
Guinea. The monkey could talk, too. He fell before I did, and I could 
hear him asking for help as he fell onto a lower "platform."

There are no primates other than humans in Papua New Guinea (I checked).
Also—and I don't know why I did not write this in my journal—I am confident in
my memory that the monkey had the voice of Gilbert Gottfried. The monkeys looked 
like some kind of macaque or baboon.

> Talking tiger turns out to be rapper dressed in rubber costume, in order to
attract female party-goers. I have to uncover all the (covered) furniture as 
a minigame. Little suitcases that self-consciously shut themselves when you
look at them are "points" I want to collect.

Rubber costumes are a theme that frequently show up in my dreams (as you might 
see). I don't know why.

> At a gymnastics convention/competition. I enter an event which involves
diving from very high in the air onto solid ground. I don't stick the
landing, but I'm alright. I get a participation trophy. I think the 
convention was held at the Santa Monica pier.

> I'm trapped in Hell, or something. I have to complete difficult tasks to not 
be tortured. The one I finally failed was to count all instances of the number 
12 in some (insurance?) document. We were floating in a void, on some strange 
structure. My captor was not visible to me, but I could hear him taunt and 
belittle me. My first punishment, incidentally, was to be sat in one place with 
no new tasks, or anything to do for one week.

For many people, I think nightmares are a source of trauma. But I
haven't had a dream that really disturbed me past waking up since I was 
young. I've mentioned this online, but I find that nightmares are a lot more
tolerable than particularly good dreams; with the latter I usually just feel
disappointed, whereas after a nightmare I always tend to wake up relieved that 
I get a "second chance."

> I'm in a relationship with [REDACTED] from school, and we live in an apartment 
with a few others. I'm in bed with him. The apartment is trashed. His roommates 
mention he's kind of a creep. I didn't believe them until he says (which appears 
in a FFVII style text box), 

>>"Rolllllllll, Rooooooollll retard \*laughs\* 

>>roooooollllll retard...."

On this day I turned 23.

Underneath this entry in my journal is a (non-dream) bullet point which reads, 
"When you sleep, you go back in time."

> I learn all about different kinds of boating games, from realistic to 
"arcade." In Cambodia, boat games will have a blue energy wall if you stray
too far.

> Some people have similar boating game setups to those driving sim rigs with 
steering wheels and such.

I have not found any information on Cambodian boat games nor how else they 
differ from the normal kind.

>I am in a taxi cab. I vividly see a UFO.

>I'm in British Columbia, but it's on the other side of the continent, and is 
named Monte Carlo. I want to explore, but I began work at [local call center]
and cannot leave my hotel room. I leave anyway. Exploring the building, there's
a lot of people especially in the lobby. French accent guy wants to know where 
he can get food. I keep seeing this beautiful pregnant woman with short, brown 
hair.

This one is fun because it highlights a bunch of stuff I'm completley unfamiliar
with yet with blind confidence I fill in the blanks. I've never been to any part 
of Canada, and I don't even know where the name Monte Carlo came from. However, 
my subconscious at least does recognize that some parts of Canada are home to a 
French-speaking population, though I don't know about BC.

It's also narratively substantial, with multiple characters and 
predicaments. I want to know more about French accent guy and the pregnant 
woman. Maybe I'll meet them again.

> We were going to play Spelunky 3D with the latest graphics mod, but [my 
friend] does not like the "Long Baby" model for the baby character. I do the
Gangnam Style dance, but [my other friend] is not impressed. It's not until I
start flossing and vibrating across the mall floor that he breaks into laughter.

I am putting this one in here entirely because of the "Long Baby". It looked 
like a normal baby except it was the size of a large dog and had a [cone head](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/9/93/Coneheads_Poster.jpg).

> I visit a ranch. There is a sheep farm. I am eating dinner, outside, at a long 
table with the farmer on one side and I on the other. The sheep are held up by 
their necks so that they learn to stand upright. The sheep are eating alongside 
us, suspended by their nooses on the sides of the table. They're taught to say 
"CHEWING" and "SWALLOWING" when they eat food. I ask the farmer why they do 
this. A particularly intelligent, disembodied sheep's head on the table tells me 
it's because it makes the sheep taste better. 

I think this one is my favorite.

> As a homework assignment, I made a rubber suit of myself with help from 
friends. But when the due date comes, I forget to bring it.

Another rubber suit dream. If you listen to my music, you might find this one
[somewhat familiar](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEFHMfG0bCY).

> This town is in disrepair. On my bike ride my companion and I are accosted. 
We walk into a family's house. They are very poor, and neglectful of their 
children. An infant shrieks and squirms in its mother's arms. Another woman 
walks by and bludgeons it to death with a small hammer or mallet. There are 
simply so many children in this house. A formless baby, melted inside a teacup 
giggling. A young boy with no eyes, curious, walking around and puffing a 
disgusting mist everywhere. There are sacs and boils of substances I can't name. 
Children who move like worms and bugs, cramped into the bathroom. The boy grabs 
my arm and doesn't let go.

One of the longer entries in my journal, this isn't so much a nightmare as it 
is disturbing in retrospect. It was certainly eerie and uncomfortable, but like
most of my nightmares I did not feel particularly afraid or upset during it.
Only after waking from this has the image of the woman killing the infant
latched into my brain.

A long gap.

> After a false awakening, [my partner] and I go on a walk to the nearby market. 
This time we use the sidewalk on the right of the street instead of our typical 
left, but I don't find that to be unusual. Whenever I look at her face, I can't 
remember if she forgot to put on her shirt correctly, uncovering her chest. But 
when I look at her chest to see, her shirt is on correctly. I chalk this 
confusion down to not being on my medication.

In fact, I began a break from my medication shortly before writing this. After 
this dream, I woke up, but not all the way. I heard the world go quiet, and the 
voice in my head announced, "SLEEP PARALYSIS NOW." Then I went into sleep 
paralysis. This remains one of the strangest sleep-related experiences that I 
have ever had.

> A masked woman. Another woman cries as new people phase in and out of 
reality next to her. We live in some kind of mansion with different sections... 
I can't remember the significance. There's a large foyer with golden marble 
walls, floors, pillars. Looks like the bank from the Matrix, but gold. I know 
the weeping woman cries because the people near her are being taken and moved 
somewhere else. She further descends into hysteria as a 2-year-old is taken 
from its mother. I am peeling an egg when I look at the masked woman, and I say, 
"Red rose. Red rose. Red rose."

Shortly after, I have a terrifying instance of sleep paralysis. I am thinking 
about Laura Palmer, as if she were real. My hearing cuts into aggressive static. 
My vision flashes red and white. I feel like I am being punished.

> 1: About to go climbing with \[[a friend](https://twitter.com/wifi_retina)]. But first, an 
attractive person cuts up bedsheets to preserve my soul.

> 2: I am naked, a child. A police officer viciously interrogates me in a back 
alley. Nearby, I can see over the heads of pedestrians a red or green square 
indicating whether or not they are positive for COVID. The police officer is 
one of them. She infects me with the disease, since she is in such close 
proximity.

The first entry here is interesting because it is one of the few I can't 
remember a bit of despite having written it down. You might have noticed
how the dates between dreams I've posted have become farther apart from one 
another. I haven't been diligent in recording my dreams as much as I was
in the beginning. This I am hoping to change.

***

That's it for now.

There are more, but many of them are not very interesting, or they contain
something I don't feel is appropriate to share (or perhaps violates the privacy 
of others). I've been thinking about adding a dreams section to this 
website so I can keep them updated and organized (ala [Ulillillia's collection](https://www.angelfire.com/journal2/ulillillia/aboutme/aboutmemuddreams.html)),
but I figure a bloog will do for now. I also will keep updated with lucid
dreaming, should I have any success with that.

How I made my latest "braindance" (???) album, Becomesher. Some general tips on how to approach making this style of music.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;So I released my latest album recently. It's called &lt;a href="https://iv-music.bandcamp.com/album/becomesher"&gt;Becomesher&lt;/a&gt;, released under the name IV. This album by far is my most developed, mature work, and I am boundlessly proud of it. I spent about 6 months working on it, and every song took on average a few weeks' time to make. You should go listen before you read the rest of this article! Though, if you don't, there are still points I think are relevant to anyone creating electronic music.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Not too long after release, I received this e-mail from somebody who enjoyed the album:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dude... Ivy... What can I say. Becomesher is amazing. I haven't heard anything close to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVPGzOHIIgz8x1hlKKQ-qF9r6jH3tm42D"&gt;Drukqs&lt;/a&gt; and you've made me a happy man by creating something along the same vein, but so unique in your own way. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was about to start my journey into creating some tracks along the Drukq vein. Out of curiosity, what are you using to create your tracks? Again... great stuff and I was also enjoying your blog posts. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Keep making music!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;O&lt;a href="#fn1" id="ref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my normal hyper-active fashion, I respond within the hour with a characteristically long-winded, unwarranted monologue in attempt to answer not only the question, but also hopefully the motivation behind it. Here is that response (with some minor edits and formatting):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey O.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First off: thanks so much, man! I really appreciate it. I'm so happy to hear that you like my album and that I could get across the vibes I was trying to convey.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every track was written and sequenced in &lt;a href="https://www.renoise.com/"&gt;Renoise&lt;/a&gt;. I highly recommend the workflow of Renoise for this kind of music, and it's been the backbone of the whole album. It's also not very hard to learn, if you have some experience with DAWs generally—I think I only started using it in December 2019, less than a year ago. Just grab the demo, read the quickstart manual and go to town. You don't need to have any experience with tracker software. I didn't have any.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also bought a cheap stereo recorder (&lt;a href="https://tascam.com/us/product/dr-05x/top"&gt;tascam dr-05x&lt;/a&gt;) and used it to record basically whatever I could think of that makes sound, much of which ended up in a lot of the songs. for ex. about half of the sounds in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AY-9HhF-WI"&gt;Hoo4!&lt;/a&gt; were recorded and lightly processed for Renoise—the claps during the drum break are all me clapping, the high pitched "beeping" melody was my microwave's beep, there is a "creaking" sound in the ambient section from an old chair I have, etc. Also the "vocals" in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vzdJ74sCaNU"&gt;Nutter Crash&lt;/a&gt; were recorded from the same device.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some songs I used &lt;a href="https://vcvrack.com/"&gt;VCV rack&lt;/a&gt; for various sounds (e.g. much of the percussion and bassline in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c5xAVfxy2MU"&gt;The Cool Dog&lt;/a&gt;, and the repeating bassline in &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m934DRSfie8"&gt;Crawdad&lt;/a&gt;). VCV is really fun when I'm tired of sequencing really precise and robotic stuff, and I just want to make some gnarly textures or rhythms or riffs or whatever.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let me give you some unwarranted general songwriting advice in this genre:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. MOST IMPORTANT THING: learn your drum patterns.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Transcribe patterns from artists you like, in order to see what they "look like" and feel like, and to get a better ear for the different common patterns and syncopations out there. this is easier than it might seem—just use your taste, there are only so many drum patterns that sound good. It also doesn't really matter what sounds you use to practice this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;common patterns include, like, four-on-the-floor beats you hear in house, techno. Also the "jungle" pattern with the one syncopated kick after the third beat (kick-and-snare-and-and-kick-snare)&lt;a href="#fn2" id="ref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. this is all pretty basic but super important. the rhythmic patterns you choose are often the very the basis for genre in electronic music. learn these and learn how to mutate them to your will.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. melody and drums are equally important.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;unless you are trying to be Autechre, then I can't help you—they are doing their own insane thing, orthogonal to what I like to make. Every note you insert, whether it be a part of a drum pattern, a melody, a bassline, or whatever, is going to be interacting simultaneously with every other note in the song. don't neglect anything! strike a balance. there is a very clear difference between minimalism and laziness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn't hurt to know a little counterpoint, or at least, &lt;a href="http://disis.music.vt.edu/eric/LyonPapers/AphexTwin/"&gt;"techno counterpoint"&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. sample choice matters.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;it is worth considering how different a drum machine one-shot will sound to a slice in some sampled funk breakbeat or whatever. I think one-shots tend to sound more "choppy" or "robotic" and require a bit more precision/tweaking, while breaks sound very stuck-together and flow more naturally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Consider the two songs "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvTLSAwFaGo"&gt;Make thedrums gofast&lt;/a&gt;" and "&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_ZzhD7TT10"&gt;WTF IV&lt;/a&gt;" from Becomesher: the first one uses almost exclusively drum machines, and the latter breakbeat samples. They have a lot of similar sounding patterns, but (for multiple reasons) I think they have very different sounds to them. Personally, I'm growing more partial to individual one-shots than breaks lately, but they both will always serve a purpose. There's a reason people are still making fresh tunes with the Amen break or Funky drummer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also, go listen to &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAFazXZKZwQ"&gt;RDJ album&lt;/a&gt; by aphex and &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jTX1AEodaqA"&gt;Hard Normal Daddy&lt;/a&gt; (or &lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOEYaBxT29U"&gt;Feed Me Weird Things&lt;/a&gt;) by Squarepusher. these are both "drill &amp;amp; bass" or "idm" albums from a similar time period, but they sound quite different from each other. One of the reasons for this is that RDJ tends to use more drum machines, whereas Squarepusher seems to prefer chopping samples. I think he's used that one break samples he does in like 30 different tracks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;iframe width="600" height="340" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LAFazXZKZwQ" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;4. have way too much time on your hands.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;or just neglect your health to do it. I mean it—a lot of this stuff is simply just grinding. like, Make Thedrums Gofast took me a really long time. I basically was writing every song, slowly, at around the same time, so it's hard to say how long any individual one took to complete, but that one I think I probably spent a couple weeks simply &lt;em&gt;hand-placing all the fucking drum hits&lt;/em&gt; in it. it can get really boring lol. My advice is to switch between whatever you're working on so you don't get bored.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And don't get too attached to stuff. I scrapped about as many half-finished WIPs as there are completed songs in the album. and I still feel like a few of those tracks are a bit unfinished. But after nearly 6 months of working on it full time I feel like you need to stop somewhere.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making music like this requires a lot of precision, which, when it comes down to it, requires a lot of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;5. steal everything.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;ok I lied, this is the most important thing. Picasso said it and I'm saying it again. steal what you can from other artists. especially things you like. but don't just steal to steal, steal to learn, and take advantage of the knowledge that comes from people who did stuff before you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I feel like just about every second in every song I made is in some way ripping off some specific artist. I could tell you their names, too, but that would maybe ruin the mystique.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, I'm sorry this email got way out of hand. but that's my advice to you, not knowing your musical history or anything. I'm not trying to be patronizing if you know all of this stuff already, lol, but let me know if you have any other questions! oh, and, would you mind if I posted this response on my blog? &lt;a href="#fn3" id="ref3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; I've been meaning to write out a "general tips" guide for a while and you gave me a good enough reason. Lol&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Best,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ivy&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#ref1" id="fn1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; Yes this email is real! Somebody actually liked it that much! I'm as floored as you are. Also, please, I love getting emails! &lt;a href="mailto:ivysly@protonmail.com"&gt;Send me one&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#ref2" id="fn2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; When you find yourself typing this out, it's time to learn notation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#ref3" id="fn3"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[3]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The answer was "yes".&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="misc"></category></entry><entry><title>Making Stuff For Its Own Sake</title><link href="https://ivysly.com/blog/making-stuff.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2020-08-12T00:00:00-07:00</published><updated>2020-08-12T00:00:00-07:00</updated><author><name>Ivy Sly</name></author><id>tag:ivysly.com,2020-08-12:/blog/making-stuff.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Showing off a font and a little toy. Some thoughts about the process of making stuff and why we (or at least I) do it.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Anyone who bears the misfortune of both knowing me and having an open private messaging inbox knows I've been keeping myself very busy during the quarantine with projects on my computer. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most important is the almost-finished music album I've poured an absolute boatload of time into since March. However, as much as it hurts to keep quiet about it, I want to make sure everything is perfect before I release, and it would just be bad form to get into its guts before the cement has cured. If you're here because you're a fan of my music, just know that it's coming out this year, and probably soon&lt;a href="#fn1", id="ref1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next focus after setting that monster of a project aside and beginning an extended break was writing this website. Inspired by an &lt;a href="https://snufk.in"&gt;e-friend&lt;/a&gt;, I copped his style just a little bit in my approach. Before July, I had no interest or knowledge of really any web-related domains, including html/css (you can tell if you look at the source), but I decided, bullheadedly, that not only would I learn just enough to get something done, but I'd also set up hosting myself on a VPS and scuffle with the DNS instead of just letting some web hosting service accomplish exactly the same thing for a marginal premium. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alongside these projects was a dream journal that has since fallen off (I'm planning another writeup on this), running through the Haskell book &amp;amp; all its exercises (which I nearly finished then promptly dropped), then the last blog. Now the focus is these next two projects I'll go into shortly. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But before I continue, understand that I'm not simply writing this article to toot my own horn, to say, &lt;em&gt;"Look at me! Look at what I did!"&lt;/em&gt;. That's a part of it, of course, but consider this blog post to be my exploration of what it means to "make things", and a personal effort to try to understand myself in why I feel so constantly compelled to do it. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that many people, including myself, are not honest with themselves about their motivations behind creating. Or, maybe, they simply don't care as much as I do about the meta aspect of it all, which, frankly, probably helps with the whole "actually making things" aspect. But, aha, is this article not just another excuse for me to create something?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, we must bite into the meat before we start chewing on the bones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;viii&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am currently writing this post in my text editor with a 8pt bitmap font called &lt;a href="https://github.com/uzkbwza/viii"&gt;viii&lt;/a&gt; that I created. Being as there's often nothing other than text on my screen, I find there is really something fulfilling about having everything on it be something I've personally &lt;em&gt;made&lt;/em&gt;.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="An example of the font being used in some code" src="images/viii.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was a satisfying little art project for me, and pragmatically a good way of squeezing some real estate out of my claustrophobic, low-dpi laptop screen. I don't really know the first thing about typography, but with such a limited space to draw points for each glyph, it starts to feel more like a meditation or puzzle than a rigorous artform. Most characters are 5x7 with an ascent and descent of 2 pixels each (I think?). Many times, especially with the bold characters, the difference between legible and not was a matter of changing one pixel. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="image-in-text"&gt;
&lt;img alt="The full set of characters in viii" src="./images/viii2.png" style="max-width:250px"&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full set of characters in viii&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I won't lie and say I didn't often look at &lt;a href="https://github.com/Tecate/bitmap-fonts"&gt;other fonts&lt;/a&gt; for guidance, 'cause I did, but I did always try to figure things out on my own first, and to take the design in a unique direction. I took from my own handwriting some quirks—for example, note the somewhat unusual finials&lt;a href="#fn2", id="ref2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt; that bend forward under some glyphs ('i', 'l', 't', and 'T'). That may have something to do with some nature of my left-handedness. Or maybe I just want to feel special. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Others I can't justify so easily, like the odds and ends on the characters "Z", "L", "E", "J", emboldened "Y", and so on—I just thought they looked interesting, and wanted to lay on some personality, and try to use this medium as a form of expression as much as possible. That's what matters, right? Legibility and cool-lookingness. Sometimes one might only even consider the aesthetics important, function be damned. In fact, earlier iterations of viii (vii? vi?) were a lot more individually flavorful, but I wanted to make some concessions for readability and neutrality. What you see in these images is the toned-down version I'm now using for my everyday computer routine. Though, really, I made viii for &lt;em&gt;my own&lt;/em&gt; personal use, and it's maybe not quite meant to be the most readable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Speaking of, &amp;quot;Legibility&amp;quot; is a very cool 
looking word in this font. Same with other 
words that use those letters, e.g. 
&amp;quot;infertilities&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;liltingly&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;oiltight&amp;quot;, 
&amp;quot;nihilities&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;milliliter&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;mistitling&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;vigintillion&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;tillite&amp;quot;
&amp;quot;vitilitigation&amp;quot;,
..." src="images/viii3.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, my own viii is similar to and occasionally identical with another 8pt bitmap font called &lt;a href="https://github.com/lucy/tewi-font"&gt;Tewi&lt;/a&gt;, which I was using myself beforehand. And, I mean, just look at it! It's pretty and clean. Tewi also has way more characters than mine, and I'm even using it as a fallback in case I encounter any characters not covered in the ISO 8859-1 series. Practically speaking, I had no reason to make a font myself. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But these things are rarely practical, aren't they? I mean, sure, the smaller size of mine and Lucy's font are useful on smaller screens, but there are dozens or hundreds or thousands of tiny bitmap fonts alike that predate either of ours. I don't know what Lucy's reasoning for making her font may have been, but for me, I feel some kind of a deeper intimacy with my writing environment now, the way a craftsman who crafts their own tools might draw deeper inspiration from them (perhaps despite their tools' relative imperfections).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My Bonsai World&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After making viii, I wanted a project I could actually use it with. I spent a few days thinking about what to do, and I remembered a &lt;a href="https://maxbittker.com/making-sandspiel"&gt;falling sand game&lt;/a&gt; someone had made in Rust, a programming language I like to use. I heavily based my code on Sandspiel's architecture, though it's a lot messier, and I still have some major issues I've yet to figure out before putting it online. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;video style="max-width:100%" controls&gt;
&lt;source src="videos/sand2.webm"&gt;
&lt;/video&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the code itself isn't really my focus here anyway. A project like this is very visceral, and most of my time spent "developing" has been just playing with the mechanics in-game and deciding whether or not they could "feel better". I understand my approach here is different (and more time consuming) than most peoples' in the same situation, but it mirrors the way I make music as well. Simply put, I've probably spent more time listening to my own music than actually making it. While that might sound like a failure in productivity on my part, doesn't it also sound like the end goal? I make the music I want to hear. I make the falling sand powder game I want to play. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I went back to play some older powder games to pick apart their mechanics, I honestly felt a little depressed. What used to be a harmless, fun activity is now a reference I have to square up to. When before I could just toy with the game and explore it curiously, I am now intimidated by the breadth of mechanics, and I feel pressured to understand how they work internally. It's not fun anymore unless it's my own—I've unknowingly sent myself to "no-fun" jail because I had the urge, once again, to do everything &lt;em&gt;my own way&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At a certain point, I feel like the drive to "do it myself" is a self-defeating mindset. I've always been sort of frustrated with this. Often I listen to some music I like, or play some game, or watch some movie, or read some book, and this demon creeps up behind me and says, &lt;em&gt;Don't you think you should make something like this too? Why don't you do that now? Why are you wasting your time consuming what someone else made, when you could make something you'd like more?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is, on one hand, a great motivator for creativity. But there is a serious tradeoff: that of taste. I said I listen to my own music more often than I make it, but allow me generalize this statement even further—&lt;strong&gt;I listen to my own music more than I listen to any others'.&lt;/strong&gt; This is not entirely out of narcissism. I listen to my own music because it is more &lt;em&gt;comfortable&lt;/em&gt; than finding something new, or hearing something I did not notice in a song I'm already familiar with. I know my own music so well that I can predict every little thing that happens and I know exactly which parts I like and which songs I don't like so much anymore. Perhaps that is related to my autism? It's very hard for me to leave my comfort zone in most areas (which is why I try to do it as much as possible).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Common Ancestor&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I barely listen to music, I barely play games, and I barely consume any other art. But this is a catch-22, because it's imperative that an artist has taste. Without it, I am often lost, and while I think it can contribute to my unique voice, I am constantly spending much more time to accomplish something another artist can do with ease. It is not sustainable to work at 150% like this all the time, and is probably a big reason why I can't seem to pick up any long-term projects. Only if I am waking up and working on one thing until I go back to sleep can I seem to stick with anything. This is not productive, it's just self-harm. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the Western canon, it seems that God (or some Gods or other) is the inspiration for most great artists. Things start to go fuzzy when you look at the past 100 years or so, of course. Picasso basically came out the womb painting. Even Steve Reich came from a musical family. Iannis Xenakis is an interesting case to me, being inspired by the ostensibly non-musical domains of architecture and mathematics, but ultimately I cannot find the missing link that brought him there in the first place. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is this thing that some people grab ahold of and others don't? No matter someone's citation for their creative inspiration, ultimately, one must put one's pencil on the paper and write their story. No matter how committed Bach was to God, there is something that happens in-between the divine inspiration and actually &lt;em&gt;manifesting it&lt;/em&gt;. What trauma leads to art? None do, but what is it that trauma leads to which in turn leads to art?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bottom line, I haven't been able to adequately answer this question: why do we make things? If you don't, why don't you? &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And am I doing it for the wrong reasons? If I did not receive validation from others, would I still be doing it? Does this make me normal for an artist, or am I unusual in this way?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Suppose I was on my own, on a desert island, with no hope of rescue? Assuming I still had free reign to a laptop (somehow), would I still make a font, or a song, or a game, or a blog post? I'd like to think it would help with the loneliness, but thus far I can't think of something I've made that I have both loved and kept only to myself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#ref1", id="fn1"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
One of the major points I need to check off is the art for the album cover and possibly a logo design. If you're a good artist or you know someone who is, I'd be happy to talk about rates. &lt;a href="mailto:ivysly@protonmail.com"&gt;Shoot me an email&lt;/a&gt; and I'll get back to you asap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#ref2", id="fn2"&gt;&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
I had to &lt;a href="https://typedecon.com/blogs/type-glossary/finial"&gt;look&lt;/a&gt; that one up.

rooms (before, Skype; further still, IRC; now, Discord) and their roles as 
highly efficient avenues for developing microculture, rapid discourse, and
sharing discovery. In the early-mid 10's I was a member 
of some extremely active groups of musicians
on Skype, and some of them have gone on to see considerable success in their 
niche&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#fn1" id="ref1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.

etiquette, direction, and, often, the path to innovation in the group's subject 
interest.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discord harmonizes with this quality. Users are given the opportunity to
now expand their groups into multiple rooms, explicitly specifying what you are 
allowed to talk about and where, with varying levels of moderator 
abities for rule enforcement and wanton power play.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;A Shortcut To Esotericism&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enter the hyperforum. &lt;strong&gt;Frozen in time, a substantially large Discord server is 
entirely indistinguishable from the message boards one might have seen 
spattering the Web in the naughts and early 10's&lt;/strong&gt;—except, this time, 
communication is &lt;em&gt;instant&lt;/em&gt;, and you don't have to spend the cash, 
time, or brain power setting it up 
yourself. 
In scope and accessibility, nothing like this has ever been done before, nor has
it even come close. The process behind hosting a place of 
discussion&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#fn2" id="ref2"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 
quickly transformed from an 
ordeal usually reserved for sorcerers with knowledge of arcane arts like "php" 
or "DNS" to something any computer-literate putz can do for free. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ding! You've received an invite to a private Discord server.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Immediately, you enter a new, 
instantly eternal universe of unintelligible discourse and 
alien social norms. Every server you're in has a hackjob Python robot arbiter 
scanning your outward messages and updating some obscure variable if your 
post matches one of its many regex 
patterns&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#fn3" id="ref3"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, it's obviously not news that any exclusive group or niche will develop 
a unique culture. But consider the 
userbase&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#fn4" id="ref4"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; we are talking about here.
Internet microcultures are blossoming into troves of art and knowledge at an
unprecedented frequency. Make no mistake, I think this is beautiful and profound, 
and the effects on meatspace outer-culture are certainly going to be 
unpredictable (this is already proving to be the case).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Insular web communities full of overly-online weirdos and teenagers 
aren't wholly without fault, however. I don't want to rehash
what a thousand people have said about why echo chambers are bad,
but I do want to touch on a few things. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;I Can't Understand What The Kids Are Saying But I Think It's Racist&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the sphere of quickly evolving discussion, one must reduce their environment to
its symbols; it's simply impossible to keep track of the holistic human
being behind every user avatar on every server you participate in. Vice versa, 
better your own identity be reduced to the symbols you choose, so
that you can adequately maintain the pace without muddying up the discourse 
(in fact, it is impossible not to do this).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While talking to a &lt;a href="https://www.instagram.com/wifihermit"&gt;friend&lt;/a&gt; about this, he made a good point to me. Consider the 
"starter pack" meme.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="An example of the starter pack meme posted to Twitter." src="https://ivysly.com/blog/images/starterpack.png"&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;An example of the starter pack meme posted to Twitter.&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The intent here is to categorize people into
"types"&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#fn5" id="ref5"&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;. Everything gets much easier
when the world becomes simple. You begin to think this way of yourself. What
starterpack describes me? What symbols do people imagine when they read my
messages? When they see my avatar? What container contains me? Is it more than
one?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This framework of pathological categorization is shared by identity politics, 
neoliberalism, capitalism, fascism, etc.—that is to say, ideologies that are bent on 
"efficiency" despite their emphasis of form over function. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, of course we are seeing a radical divide towards the extremes. Reducing the 
world to its signifiers leaves no room for anything else. And it's obvious why
even the most heinous poasters don't pay their actions any mind: people in webforums 
are no longer material human beings. We are primarily &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; engaging with the 
material. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what difference does it make when you're only racist online?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, for one, most people can't help but to be their race &lt;em&gt;all of the time&lt;/em&gt;. 
Also, now that we've established an environment of symbolism and
identity politics, what you do or say online is indistinguishable from what
you do in material space. You aren't only racist online, you're only racist
&lt;em&gt;sometimes&lt;/em&gt;. There is no difference; the medium is no longer the message.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are many names for the vehement response to online fascism; 
"Cancel culture", "censorship", "SJW" something or other. But ultimately
how the Left responds to this is barely praxis at all. &lt;strong&gt;It does not matter
if you are "cancelled". It means nothing.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Macrochannel: The Long Way Around to The Thing You Were Already Doing&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get too far ahead of myself, let's talk about the underlying 
canvas of internet discourse, so that we can see how these large-scale
interactions (e.g. being "cancelled") are taking place.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Twitter is what I call a "macrochannel"—in other words, Twitter is more like
an IRC channel than Discord is, but with a few dozen million active users and only 
a pittance of options to filter them out. The difference between the apparent use 
cases is surprising; Discord is home to sprawling community, but Twitter's 
deliberate lack of structure seems to at best lead to small niche in-groups, and they 
are all under constant surveillance by those adjacent to 
them&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#fn6" id="ref6"&gt;[6]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Interestingly, the more public-facing, "open" center of discussion seems like the 
least conducive to it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's important, also, to understand that Twitter has an understated, tertiary, 
emergent function. Twitter itself is an efficient 
backdoor to many of the closed communities on
hyperforums. If a link is not 
already in someone's bio, it only takes a 
bit of parasocial trust-building before you are 
invited to the back stage workshop 
responsible for a cult of personality. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This binary is largely what separates modern internet discourse from its past forms. 
Despite their enormous popularity in the same crowds, a state of tension exists 
between the communities on Discord and those on Twitter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The Invisible Hand of Meta-Slacktivism and Zoomer PR&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is happening when two or more of these Twitter accounts clash
publicly, with seemingly no setup or substantial history between the two?
Of course people have their private affairs, and sometimes they go public, 
but I posit there tends to be a manufactured element to this—not that either 
party are being ingenuine, nor that bad blood is farcical, nor that allegations 
are untrue, but that often the goal of and process behind this is more than just 
realizing one's own desire for justice or conflict. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your identity is not just showcased by these interactions, 
it is &lt;em&gt;defined&lt;/em&gt; by them. Your vicious beef with @cum_chungus69
encompasses more than just your distaste for them; it is the basis for your
claim to humanity inside the chatroom (take a look at the accounts people call 
"bots". Usually, they aren't). After all, isn't there a reason we are making
anything public? Isn't the idea to delegate influence within the platform you
are on? It is not like we are in town square, and can punish offenders directly,
or vote on some legislature, or &lt;em&gt;win anything&lt;/em&gt;. We can't &lt;em&gt;do a communism&lt;/em&gt; on 
Twitter—categorically this does not even make sense. Ultimately, 
no matter how right your cause is, the best thing you can do is put an asterisk 
on someone's entry in the archive.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Well, fuck it, that's what we're gonna have to do then, right?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Discord is the perfect engine for this. It is a tool molded for 
the microculture war, something a niche can use to determine where to draw the border
between us and them, something they can use to delimit what dirt is and subsequently 
dig it up. With tools like this, we've reached a new capacity for the simulation 
of activism on the internet.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understand that I am not 
even referring to something like the 
"leftists vs fascists"
conflict, because this is occuring on much smaller levels too: "leftists vs 
different leftists", "philosophy dweebs vs teenagers", "anime pfp's vs normal
people", "kpop stans vs..."&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#fn7" id="ref7"&gt;[7]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be helpful to understand it like this: the Twitter matrix 
is simultaneously the history book written by the cumulative minds of hyperforums (on 
Discord) and the battleground they are fighting on; it is the history book in that 
it is pseudo-nonfiction (all Twitter personalities and interactions between them 
are inherently editorialized), and the battleground because it is 
nonetheless a place of genuine ideological conflict—it is &lt;em&gt;hyperreal&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref1" id="fn1"&gt;[1]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 
Unfortunately, my niche was and remains "whatever I'm feeling
like doing at the time". I'll let you know when it works out.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref2" id="fn2"&gt;[2]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 
While we are making up words, how about "cyber-symposium"?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref3" id="fn3"&gt;[3]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 
Of course, it may alert you to this, or it may not—or perhaps
instead you may simply query the robot and it will harmlessly spit out a
naked or half-naked anime woman back at you, and for one small moment you are
invited to enjoy the artwork before it is consumed by the endless swathes of
newer posts; infinitely ninja'd. This impermance is illusory, though. That 
catgirl will be there for as long as the server exists, and Discord itself 
invites you to index it for older messages in a way  much more akin 
to a bulletin board than an IRC channel. 
At what point are we still calling Discord a chatroom?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref4" id="fn4"&gt;[4]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 
I do not mean to alarm you, but twenty-somethings masquerading as 
Japanese cartoon girls are exposing your teenager to Deleuze &lt;em&gt;this very second&lt;/em&gt;. 
And there's nothing you can do about it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;sup&gt;&lt;a href="#ref5" id="fn5"&gt;[5]&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;

popular at the time of writing. Furthermore, at this point, 
suffice it to say that Jean Baudrillard's writings on 
simulation and symbols are relevant to the whole article.
I suggest afterwards you skim the book, &lt;em&gt;Simulacra and Simulation&lt;/em&gt;, which you can 
find pdf's of on Google.&lt;/p&gt;

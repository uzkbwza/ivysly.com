put screenshake in your game. screenshake is the secret to a game that *feels good*. if you don't put it in your game, your game may not *feel good*. the purpose of a game is to *feel good*. we have perfected the formula to making a game *feel good*. if you follow this formula your game will *feel good* and thus it will be good. 

video games are just interfaces for sensation. we have extracted sweet sensation from pesky semantics. there's no more need for intention. screen shake no longer has to convey *impact*. it doesn't need to convey anything. just do whatever you want. we are currently developing a game that is nothing but shaking and squishing and sloshing. baddies flash white when you swat them but also the goodies and everything else even if you don't swat them. particle effects. stop thinking about it and start feeling about it. we are looking into haptic ecstacy.

making a game is the real game. you need snapping and fizzing and swishing and zapping. i don't care where you put it. put it anywhere. it's a fucking *video game*. did you know that in 2024 the games industry alone pulled in $184 billion dollars? why would you waste your time thinking when there is money to be made? look at all the other games around you: they are squishy and huggy and cozy and every time you do anything the game rewards you with an outpouring of sickeningly sweet *juice*. your game needs to be sexual, it needs to simulate orgasm, and you need kids to buy it. what the fuck else are you making these for?

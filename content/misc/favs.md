## games:

i can't talk about my favorite games without bringing up [Super Smash Bros. Melee](https://www.ssbwiki.com/Super_Smash_Bros._Melee). no other game has the sauce like this one. while developments in the *metagame* have rendered much of my playstyle obsolete, i think this is perhaps the ultimate game for trying cool stuff and seeing what happens. but maybe that is because i have played it for dozens of thousands of hours.

i also really like [Dungeon Crawl Stone Soup](https://crawl.develz.org), an unbelievably good old-school tactical roguelike. still in active development after <time datetime="1995" data-timeformat="relative"></time>, DCSS is one of if not the best in the format. the game is relatively accessible (thanks to years of effort on this front) and fully playable without a wiki (though it helps) and, despite some crust, remains one of the most engaging strategy games ever made. it's also free and open-source. the devs' writeup on their [design philosophy](https://github.com/crawl/crawl/blob/master/crawl-ref/docs/crawl_manual.rst#n-philosophy-pas-de-faq) is very useful and inspiring as a game developer.

[Nuclear Throne](https://store.steampowered.com/app/242680/Nuclear_Throne/) is pretty much what every indie dev should aspire to, realistically. it's just an all-around excellent game that scores huge points in every category. it's immensely cathartic, low-commitment and highly rewards player skill. like the prior two games mentioned i have dumped embarrassing amounts of time into this one.

otherwise, generally speaking i've always enjoyed fighting games (though i am miserably bad at them, even Melee). what i love most about them is the spectacle. i tend to gravitate toward anime fighters like [ggac+r](https://store.steampowered.com/app/348550/GUILTY_GEAR_XX_ACCENT_CORE_PLUS_R/), [mbaacc](https://play.meltyblood.club/) and [bbcf](https://store.steampowered.com/app/586140/BlazBlue_Centralfiction/) for that reason.

## music:

i really mostly listen to electronic music, and my favorites are mainly on the experimental and analog side of things, like [Aphex Twin](http://youtube.com/watch?v=R-5koLtMy98), [SFV Acid](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLN_G7yTx9SXedsAOVyTm_8TuiTv6BaLs7), and [Cylob](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_kh5sKvno_Q3ESWsbF9AIWn7OsWvdRo8ME). I also like chiptune artists such as [RRThiel](https://soundcloud.com/rrthielnc) and [kfaraday](https://soundcloud.com/ygasasa/). not much more to say about this, who talks about music when you could just listen???

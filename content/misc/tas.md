Summary: making videos about games but they are played by computers

i sometimes make [tool-assisted](https://tasvideos.org/) speedruuuhhh superplays? playarounds? i am not sure what they are called, but i'm not really interested in the speedrun part. i care more about making something that **looks baller**. TAS is also the basis of the design for my fighting game, [Your Only Move Is HUSTLE](../games/your-only-move-is-hustle.html).

youtube embeds are getting blocked on my website for some reason, so click on this gif of yoshi to enter a playlist of my tas videos:

mainly what i have TAS'd is a little known game called super smash brothers. melee for the nintendo gamecube. i've played with other games but haven't published anything with them.

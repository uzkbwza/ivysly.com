Summary: chatbots and other little internet machines

i like to make chatbots and other little internet machines. listed are some of them, organized by platform:

#### Bluesky
- [Your New Name](https://bsky.app/profile/your-new-name.bsky.social) periodically posts a procedurally-generated name. i've been working on this for a few years, mainly adjusting and weighing which input corpuses are used. the [name generator](https://github.com/uzkbwza/namer) i wrote for it was one of my first Rust projects and can output millions of names in seconds.
#### Discord
- [hmmmmmm bot](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=714976319921717268&permissions=8&scope=bot) is an agent of chaos whose featureset includes being annoying on purpose, automatic nickname assignment using the previously mentioned technology (plus some extra perks), tarot readings, and ranking your posts based on how many times you said iphone.
- [Wisdom of the Guild](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1324561925329391636) is a simple chatbot for anonymously archiving and retrieving posts within a server, inspired by the DCSS knowledge bot.

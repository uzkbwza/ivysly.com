I'm at the theatre, watching the new breaking bad reboot movie with adam driver. later I'm at S's house. he asks me about the movie, and I say that it was boring, and I preferred the new aqua teen episode they showed which was really overwhelmingly, paralyzingly funny. I drop two arrowhead shaped pixels on the ground, and have a hard time picking them up; I keep pricking my fingers on them. S suggests we cut them in half with scissors, as they make a cool looking CD effect on the inside. S asks if he can log into my Xbox controller. I tell him the password is 6,000,000,000,000.

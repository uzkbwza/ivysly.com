I'm in a spacious, plain looking building like a school or a hospital. I've got my field mic and I'm recording my own footsteps. I noticed some orchestral music was interfering with the recording, but I couldn't find the source. I end up in a concert hall with the seats like bleachers in how steeply they ascend, nobody is in them. the whole concert hall is empty but the music is quite loud, and I'm trying to find the source. I walk up the stairs and I find at the top of them a door to another completely full concert hall where the orchestra is playing very loud.

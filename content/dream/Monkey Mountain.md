A monkey loses his sponsorship after a climbing injury in the jungle gym. I explain this to another monkey on a very thin ledge at the top of a humongous mountain. The monkey falls off the ledge, then so do I. We fall into the expansive jungle. I distinctly remember the jungle being in Papua New Guinea. The monkey could talk, too. He fell before I did, and I could hear him asking for help as he fell onto a lower "platform." (writer's note: there are no monkeys in Papua New Guinea)

A shooting star outside my hotel, it's so close I can hear it sizzle in the air and it crashes nearby in the forest. I take my phone and start to record its landing spot. it's glowing faintly red. I hear screams and explosions and look up, still recording, to see dozens more shooting stars colliding into each other and raining down chunks of rock. I see another giant Earth in the sky. I run back into the hotel and the staff are ushering people somewhere. a man is crying and threatening suicide.

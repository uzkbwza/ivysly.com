on a walk with dennis. I let him roam around the trail off leash. I decided to get on the bus and then meet up with him further along the trail, but I get distracted and a bunch of things go wrong. eventually I decide R probably found him and took him home. I bus home, and when I get there, a bunch of other white dogs are there but not dennis. these dogs belong to R's dad who is visiting. I panic and run back outside leaving all the doors open. I begin yelling his name and other people do too, the whole neighborhood wants to find him. there are lots of other dogs being walked today. eventually I see him being walked around by someone else. Dennis is wearing a t shirt. I get the attention of the person who has him and I take him back home

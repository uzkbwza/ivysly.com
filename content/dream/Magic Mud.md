small town in Oregon. built on an incline. surrounding it are giant beautiful hills/mountains and a thick layer of mist. gravity is skewed. nearby "dirt pits" where mud and dirt shifts and floats around in strange shapes. there's a mountain shaped hill, at the top there is a crater shaped inlet with labyrinthine patterns of mud. from it a heavy vibration occurs periodically.

Title: Junk Labyrinth

I'm escorting my girlfriend and some others down from the top of a giant concrete wall structure that looks like a castle. it's part of a giant circular structure that reminds me of the labyrinth structure in the short story The Immortal. it's filled with junk and debris. the atmosphere is tense, it feels like everyone is looking for a reason to mug or hurt us. descending a staircase, I make a show of levitating above the steps with my eyes glowing white to intimidate them. a long-haired, overweight man wearing a backward baseball cap says to the person next to him, "see, that's what they do."

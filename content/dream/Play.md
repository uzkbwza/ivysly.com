N writes and "performs" a "play" in G's history class (it really is just a video he plays on the projector). the script was really good when he wrote it but at some point along the production process it changed direction. it begins with him monologuing over footage of a fly on a dog's corpse for twenty minutes. after that there is a white-on-black animated section about 3 kids who turn into different creatures and consume different media/foods (?) until it kills(?) them (gets fuzzy after this)

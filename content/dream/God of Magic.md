I begin worshipping the god of magic. I meet this guy on the road talking about the trigonometric ratios. he asks at some point in this conversation if I'm a virgin. I say, maybe in *this* lifetime. i ask if he believes in magic. I have a basket of blue apples. I roll one down the sidewalk. then I throw another at the first. trigonometry bitch. he wasn't looking tho. so we go inside. it's my grandparents old house. S is there. she says wow that's gorgeous. I ask if she is referring to my buzzed blue hair. she says no it's two autistic people.

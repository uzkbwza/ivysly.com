I'm in a barn... it's dark. all I remember about this part.

I'm in a car as a passenger, on the highway. in front of me is another car, and a famous actor is getting it on with a woman in the back seat. the person I'm with sees this and is consumed by jealousy, as she thought they had something special.

I sat down to watch an old movie from my childhood (something like the wizard of oz though I don't think it was that, nor any real movie) and the moment it started playing I began weeping and couldn't stop, I was so moved by nostalgia.

A masked woman. Another woman cries as new people phase in and out of reality next to her. We live in some kind of mansion with different sections... I can't remember the significance. There's a large foyer with golden marble walls, floors, pillars. Looks like the bank from the Matrix, but gold. I know the weeping woman cries because the people near her are being taken and moved somewhere else. She further descends into hysteria as a 2-year-old is taken from its mother. I am peeling an egg when I look at the masked woman, and I say, "Red rose. Red rose. Red rose."

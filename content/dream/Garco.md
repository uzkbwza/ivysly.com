N(?) and i are escaping from revolution-era army men wielding rifles with giant bayonets. we enter a warmly lit cave and there is a wall of climbable blocks with letters on them. one of the rows of blocks spells out "GARCO". as i start climbing, N is impaled by a bayonet through his back and out his chest, and he dies.

I'm outside at a park in the city thinking about 7g(?), a new internet service where you buy bagged internet and pop a hole in the bag to let it slowly fill your home. the bags are like little Amazon prime packages. I'm thinking about how these might negatively affect people (you could choke/trip on the bags?) when a man talking to himself walks by. suddenly he pulls a gun and says "what it is white boy? 66 cents says I get a body shot!" I climb up onto the fence and bob up and down to make it harder for him to aim

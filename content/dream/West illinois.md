we're watching an 1800s period movie in class set near West Illinois, a small US-owned territory near Panama, and there's a battle scene where one side uses giant rolling and sliding rocks. I notice the sliding rocks have an unusual inertia, they don't seem to slow down. later in climbing/parkour gym class I ask how this is possible and nobody can give me an answer, not even the smart kid. everyone just accepts this as a natural property of large rocks.

when I'm at the airport, still nobody can answer, but it's cool to see how they build the planes around the pilot seats right before boarding. the airport looks like a giant spacious warehouse, with escalators here and there to get to different floors.

after leaving S's house, he says I should bring more of our friends instead of hanging out alone. he mentions K, and I say I haven't seen him in years. Suddenly K shows up and we walk home together through the South Hills. it starts raining pretty bad and my shoes get soaked. A young girl has joined us and I want to protect her on the walk back.

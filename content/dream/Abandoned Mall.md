I am a young woman. my friends and I are in a large abandoned open-air structure like a mall with giant blown out windows. we come across a man who wants to trap us here. he says if we attack him, his dog will attack us and at least one of us will die. he eventually kills all of my friends, trying to trap me. I fight him. I bite off his ear. the sight of his blood makes me sick. I crush him between an angled metal cellar door and its frame.

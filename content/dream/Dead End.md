accidentally drove my car onto an elevated train track in Philadelphia. it ends up in a dead end on the tracks, in the middle of the city, safe from being hit, but impossible to get back in and drive out. it faces a ramp that leads into a big body of water. the train goes right over it. we try to cooperate with the city to get it back out, but nothing seems to work. eventually we try a plan where N and I disguise ourselves as clowns and do a comedy routine to distract the passengers. we stall the train above the car, I exit and throw it off the tracks onto the concrete. everyone celebrates.

I'm downtown, and the military is here. a woman is doing bag checks on the side walk. I walk the other way.  army men in tanks are driving down the street. there's a staircase up to the market, I take it. one of them stop me and do a pat down. they ask to look in my mouth, and find some plastic shit I'm anxiously chewing on. this confounds them and they consider if I'm on drugs, but ultimately let me go.

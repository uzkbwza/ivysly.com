After a false awakening, R and I go on a walk to the nearby market. This time we use the sidewalk on the right of the street instead of our typical left, but I don't find that to be unusual. Whenever I look at her face, I can't remember if she forgot to put on her shirt correctly, uncovering her chest. But when I look at her chest to see, her shirt is on correctly. I chalk this confusion down to not being on my medication.

This town is in disrepair. On my bike ride my companion and I are accosted. We walk into a family's house. They are very poor, and neglectful of their children. An infant shrieks and squirms in its mother's arms. Another woman walks by and bludgeons it to death with a small hammer or mallet. There are simply so many children in this house. A formless baby, melted inside a teacup giggling. A young boy with no eyes, curious, walking around and puffing a disgusting mist everywhere. There are sacs and boils of substances I can't name. Children who move like worms and bugs, cramped into the bathroom. The boy grabs my arm and doesn't let go.

I'm jumping around in low gravity at a gathering with my family, somewhere in the city, in a strange large building. I forgot to get my oxygen device so I'm holding my breath jumping around trying to find the exit, and I do just in time. I find my cousin C, who tells me he has been "de-brained and re-brained." I don't want to go back inside, because I'm covered in sweat.

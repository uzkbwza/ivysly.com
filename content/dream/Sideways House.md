I try to sleep(?) in a sideways house but it looks too unstable. sure enough it crumbles. my mom walks through the wreckage to catch up with me, but we are both caught by fiberglass in the air which cuts our skin.
R and I meet up with H, and end up flying to Japan. R says something like "now you can teach me about the culture here" and H is like "I am Chinese lol" and we both fly to China. H can't leave China until a court decides he can. R (or H, I can't remember) writes a sentimental blog post about the whole thing. As I'm preparing to fly back to the US, I realize that I might be boarding the plane incorrectly, by hanging on tightly to its exterior. I wonder if I will die.

walking up the concrete steps to the train station. later, I'm doing a long trek through the desert in eastern Oregon between two forested landmarks, walking alongside the highway. I collapse on the ground. everyone is wondering what's wrong and then C notices all my organs have fallen out, and some of them are coming out of my mouth. she calls 911.

walking up the steps at the train station, slowly. my body has been put back together but I'm unrecognizable. I look like they only haphazardly put my skin back on. I feel like the worst version of RoboCop. I have no mouth anymore, and my hands are little plastic toys that can make a finger gun gesture. my mouth protects my organs, so I need to protect my mouth. I walk by a woman in a similar condition. I make finger guns at her. as I walk the reality of my situation sets in, and it makes me very sad.

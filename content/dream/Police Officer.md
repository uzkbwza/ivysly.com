I am naked, a child. A police officer who looks like Kamala Harris viciously beats and interrogates me in an alley. Nearby, I can see over the heads of pedestrians a red or green square indicating whether or not they are positive for COVID. The police officer is one of them. She infects me with the disease, since she is in such close proximity.

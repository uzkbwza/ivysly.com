Slug: patchnotes/1.9.5

*   Lobbies now wait for characters to load, this should fix the "mod mismatch" issue
*   Adjusted sound effect for all level-1 supers (think of them like EX moves...)
*   Added some global freeze frames on hit/block. Shouldn't affect gameplay at all. The goal is to make full-speed replays a little more watchable and satisfying.

    *   You can turn it off in the options if you want, for now.
    *   Might break some modded character cutscenes?

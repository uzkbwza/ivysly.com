my name is Ian Sly (Ivy is just Ian upside-down; you can call me either). the thing you may already know about me is that i created a turn-based fighting game called [*Your Only Move Is HUSTLE*](./games/your-only-move-is-hustle.html). below are some other details.

i was born in Portland, Oregon, and have lived in the nearby city of Eugene since i was eight. assuming i have not died by the time you read this, i am <time datetime="1997-05-07" data-timeformat="relative"></time> old. <time datetime="2015" data-timeformat="relative"></time> ago i dropped out of high school to smoke weed and play video games. since then i made a lot of [video games](./games.html) and [computer music](./music.html). the internet tells me i am a Taurus, INFP, a cusp Zoomer, and a wordcel. i am nonreligious. you could place my political beliefs on the anarchist spectrum.

i have never worked a real job and I do not plan to. i think everyone should have the opportunity to not work. i would sooner return to living on pennies in a tin can apartment than lose the capacity to be creative during daylight hours. what a joke it is that all you need to go from deadbeat slacker to *entrepreneur* is a little profit.

making stuff is my life path. it is involuntary and invariant. just writing this sentence is satisfying. fixations have shaped every decision i've ever made.

if you like the way i talk, you can read my [blog](./blog.html). if you like the way i think, you can take a look at my [dreams](./dream.html). if you think the way i like, we might agree on my [favs](./misc/favs.html). and if you just don't like me, you might still like my [friends](./misc/friends.html).

i am, lastly, the sole credited inventor of a widely acclaimed data structure called the bonglewunch.

lately i have been making a lot of chiptune, using the monumentally good tracker software [Furnace](https://github.com/tildearrow/furnace). prior to that i used a lot of [Renoise](https://www.renoise.com/), but for most of my time making music it has been with good old [Fruity Loops](https://www.image-line.com/).

i'm planning to host more of my music on this website so you can download or stream it directly from here, but i have a lot of old stuff to dig through. about [<time datetime="2010" data-timeformat="relative"></time>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMN_APHw4as) of it... stay tuned

It's boring. It has severe pacing issues. The challenges presented are more tedious than stimulating. The "RPG" elements are basically non-existent. The combat is terrible. Building is creative but also completely unrewarding. Minecraft doesn't know what it wants to be and accomplishes nothing well, except that initial feeling of awesome scale that quickly turns to disappointment when you realize there is nothing to do in its infinitely huge world.

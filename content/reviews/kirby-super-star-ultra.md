Every time I play a Kirby game I'm always blown away by the polish and Super Star Ultra has polish in excess. each ability has a particularly fleshed out moveset compared to prior games with unique but intuitive controls for each, and they're all pretty satisfying to use because of how unreal the visual and sound design is in this game, not to mention how tight and deliberate Kirby's controls are on their own (and Meta Knight is a whole lot of fun in his own right being the Vergil to Kirby's Dante). the attention to detail is unmatched. the music is so cracked it's unfair—i don't think I've heard a better game soundtrack in my life. it's a great example of that infinite Nintendo money put to good use. I only wish it weren't so easy, and that I played it as a kid. play co-op if you can.

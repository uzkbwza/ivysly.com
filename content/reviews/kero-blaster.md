This is a great little run & gun that does little to innovate but nails the execution. That's all that really matters anyway. Good study material for level designers. It looks nice and the music & sound design is great.

There is some crust in staying so true to its roots. The control scheme is pretty awkward. Switching weapons is a pain, and sometimes turning around while shooting doesn't work the way you'd expect. You also have to retread the entire level on a game-over, which can get a little annoying in the later levels (which are relatively long) but the game is only about 2-3 hours anyway so this is hardly an issue.

Bottom line is that you should play Kero Blaster if you've ever enjoyed a game where you shoot a gun and "side scroll".

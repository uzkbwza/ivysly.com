BLOOD GOLF is a PVP or PVE golf-em-up where your target is the other player. Use powerups, map knowledge, and, most importantly, elegant combat-golf technique to turn your enemies into a fine mist or send them past the stratosphere. Has local multiplayer, or you can fight against the CPU. I made this game with [blauxel](https://linktr.ee/blautre) who drew all the art.

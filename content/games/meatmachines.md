here is a game [HIS](https://humanisred.itch.io/) and i were working on for a while but had to pause indefinitely for various reasons. in this game you build machines made out of meat and use them to attack other machines. gamepads and local co-op are supported. sorry it runs like crap and the tutorial sucks but i think it's pretty fun otherwise

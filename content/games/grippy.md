GRiPPY is a hardcore, subversive platformer for the PICO-8 system about climbing through a mysterious underground complex and overcoming hostile terrain. You play as Grippy, a creature with very, very strong arms, but no legs. You must travel by hurling yourself across the world and latching onto anything you can grip. This was my first PICO-8 game and my first finished game.

## Controls
- O/X (z/x on keyboard): reach out a hand and grab 
- left/right: rotate aim angle 
- down (hold): aiming mode; reach without grabbing
- up: hop

You can change your control settings in the pause menu.

Defy Godwin is a comedic work of interactive fiction and a realistic forum simulator.

Godwin’s Law: As a discussion on the Internet goes on, the probability of a comparison to Nazis or Adolf Hitler approaches 1.

Amidst a war of rhetoric, you are but an internet forum moderator - the impartial paramedic of a digital battlefield. With a new corporate leadership buying out your home base @ Hyperlink Heaven, your mission is now to appease advertisers by preventing users from invoking Nazism (and thus Godwin’s Law). Slap and exile in your vain attempt to stifle their discussions’ inevitable conclusion. Use your wit and read between the lines to end these battles before they even start.

This game was made with personal friends who contributed the majority of the writing and prefer to remain anonymous.

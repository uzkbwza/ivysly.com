🏆 #1 for "Fun" in ludum dare 49 compo

Here is my take on the “unstable” theme for Ludum Dare 49. You operate a malfunctioning quantum supergun, which shoots things it probably isn’t supposed to. Achieve superiority over your friends by travelling further through the Dungeon of Enemies than they can.

Every bullet you can shoot is unique, and all have the capacity to save your life or spell your death in their own ways.

Only available to play in-browser on itch.io. Maybe I'll put it here later.

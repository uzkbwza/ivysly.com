Evil Egg was an ecstatic twin-stick nightmare known for its brutal shooting action and intense audiovisual effects. Infinite horrors tear apart a world of little green men, the only hope an errant hatchling.

The last known Evil Egg arcade cabinet to remain was recovered in Eugene, Oregon, found in a state of extreme disrepair. This digital release is a faithful emulation of the original hardware, made possible by a restoration effort led by a small team of dedicated preservationists. The private collector responsible for the machine's donation has asked to remain anonymous.

Features:

- CLASSIC, FULLY ANALOG TWIN-STICK BLASTING  
- UNIQUE ASSORTMENT OF ENEMIES, HAZARDS, POWERUPS AND ARTEFACTS  
- INFINITE LEVELS IF YOU CAN REACH THEM  
- SCORE SYSTEM REWARDING SKILL AND FUN  
- ONLINE LEADERBOARDS

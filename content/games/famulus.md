Famulus is a short, retro-style shoot-em-up-and-down adventure game about kebabs made by me (programming, sounds, graphics) in about 2 weeks for Sewer Jam 5. 

can be played with the keyboard or a gamepad. press F11 or Alt+Enter to toggle fullscreen.

this game is pretty derivative but perhaps fun. the primary goal for this project was to ensure that my new game engine (built with LÖVE) is complete enough to power an actual game, even if it is a small one.

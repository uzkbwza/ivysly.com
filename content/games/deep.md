DEEP is an endless-driller rogue-lite where the player is multi-tasked with plunging a byzantine drilling machine into the earth, plundering its resources and fending off hordes of horrible creatures. 

Made in just under two weeks, including all art, sounds, and music.

Apologies in advance: this game runs like crap. It also crashes for some people. I don't know why. I'M SORRY!
